    "title": "Cholesterol Metabolism by Uncultured Human Gut Bacteria Influences Host Cholesterol Level.",
    "abstract": "The human microbiome encodes extensive metabolic capabilities, but our understanding of the mechanisms linking gut microbes to human metabolism remains limited. Here, we focus on the conversion of cholesterol to the poorly absorbed sterol coprostanol by the gut microbiota to develop a framework for the identification of functional enzymes and microbes. By integrating paired metagenomics and metabolomics data from existing cohorts with biochemical knowledge and experimentation, we predict and validate a group of microbial cholesterol dehydrogenases that contribute to coprostanol formation. These enzymes are encoded by ismA genes in a clade of uncultured microorganisms, which are prevalent in geographically diverse human cohorts. Individuals harboring coprostanol-forming microbes have significantly lower fecal cholesterol levels and lower serum total cholesterol with effects comparable to those attributed to variations in lipid homeostasis genes. Thus, cholesterol metabolism by these microbes may play important roles in reducing intestinal and serum cholesterol concentrations, directly impacting human health.",

    "abstract": "Food and human health are inextricably linked. As such, revolutionary impacts on health have been derived from advances in the production and distribution of food relating to food safety and fortification with micronutrients. During the past two decades, it has become apparent that the human microbiome has the potential to modulate health, including in ways that may be related to diet and the composition of specific foods. Despite the excitement and potential surrounding this area, the complexity of the gut microbiome, the chemical composition of food, and their interplay <i>in situ</i> remains a daunting task to fully understand. However, recent advances in high-throughput sequencing, metabolomics profiling, compositional analysis of food, and the emergence of electronic health records provide new sources of data that can contribute to addressing this challenge. Computational science will play an essential role in this effort as it will provide the foundation to integrate these data layers and derive insights capable of revealing and understanding the complex interactions between diet, gut microbiome, and health. Here, we review the current knowledge on diet-health-gut microbiota, relevant data sources, bioinformatics tools, machine learning capabilities, as well as the intellectual property and legislative regulatory landscape. We provide guidance on employing machine learning and data analytics, identify gaps in current methods, and describe new scenarios to be unlocked in the next few years in the context of current knowledge.",

    "title": "Metagenomic Analysis of the Gut Microbiota of Wild Mice, a Newly Identified Reservoir of <i>Campylobacter</i>.",
    "abstract": "<i>Campylobacter</i>, the most common etiologic agent of zoonotic gastroenteritis in humans, is present in many reservoirs including livestock animals, wildlife, soil, and water. Previously, we reported a novel <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> strain SCJK02 (MLST ST-8388) from the gut of wild mice (<i>Micromys minutus</i>) using culture-dependent methods. However, due to fastidious growth conditions and the presence of viable but non-culturable <i>Campylobacter</i> spp., it is unclear whether <i>M. minutus</i> is a <i>Campylobacter</i> reservoir. This study aimed to: 1) determine the distribution and proportion of <i>Campylobacter</i> spp. in the gut microbiota of wild mice using culture-independent methods and 2) investigate the gut microbiota of wild mice and the relationship of <i>Campylobacter</i> spp. with other gut microbes. The gut microbiota of 38 wild mice captured from perilla fields in Korea and without any clinical symptoms (18 <i>M. minutus</i> and 20 <i>Mus musculus</i>) were analyzed. Metagenomic analysis showed that 77.8% (14 of 18) of the captured <i>M. minutus</i> harbored <i>Campylobacter</i> spp. (0.24-32.92%) in the gut metagenome, whereas none of the captured <i>M. musculus</i> carried <i>Campylobacter</i> spp. in their guts. Notably, 75% (6 of 8) of <i>M. minutus</i> determined to be <i>Campylobacter</i>-negative using culture-dependent methods showed a high proportion of <i>Campylobacter</i> through metagenome analysis. The results of metagenome analysis and the absence of clinical symptoms suggest that <i>Campylobacter</i> may be a component of the normal gut flora of wild <i>M. minutus</i>. Furthermore, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) showed that <i>Campylobacter</i> was the most enriched genus in the gut microbiota of <i>M. minutus</i> (LDA score, 5.37), whereas <i>Lactobacillus</i> was the most enriched genus in <i>M. musculus</i> (LDA score, -5.96). The differences in the presence of <i>Campylobacter</i> between the two species of wild mice may be attributed to the differential abundance of <i>Campylobacter</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> in their respective gut microbiota. In conclusion, the results indicate that wild <i>M. minutus</i> may serve as a potential <i>Campylobacter</i> reservoir. This study presents the first metagenomics analysis of the <i>M. minutus</i> gut microbiota to explore its possible role as an environmental <i>Campylobacter</i> reservoir and provides a basis for future studies using culture-independent methods to determine the role of environmental reservoirs in <i>Campylobacter</i> transmission.",

    "title": "Multi-omics analysis reveals the influence of genetic and environmental risk factors on developing gut microbiota in infants at risk of celiac disease.",
    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune digestive disorder that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals in response to ingesting gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Research shows that genetic predisposition and exposure to gluten are necessary but not sufficient to trigger the development of CD. This suggests that exposure to other environmental stimuli early in life, e.g., cesarean section delivery and exposure to antibiotics or formula feeding, may also play a key role in CD pathogenesis through yet unknown mechanisms. Here, we use multi-omics analysis to investigate how genetic and early environmental risk factors alter the development of the gut microbiota in infants at risk of CD.<h4>Results</h4>Toward this end, we selected 31 infants from a large-scale prospective birth cohort study of infants with a first-degree relative with CD. We then performed rigorous multivariate association, cross-sectional, and longitudinal analyses using metagenomic and metabolomic data collected at birth, 3 months and 6 months of age to explore the impact of genetic predisposition and environmental risk factors on the gut microbiota composition, function, and metabolome prior to the introduction of trigger (gluten). These analyses revealed several microbial species, functional pathways, and metabolites that are associated with each genetic and environmental risk factor or that are differentially abundant between environmentally exposed and non-exposed infants or between time points. Among our significant findings, we found that cesarean section delivery is associated with a decreased abundance of Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides dorei and of folate biosynthesis pathway and with an increased abundance of hydroxyphenylacetic acid, alterations that are implicated in immune system dysfunction and inflammatory conditions. Additionally, longitudinal analysis revealed that, in infants not exposed to any environmental risk factor, the abundances of Bacteroides uniformis and of metabolite 3-3-hydroxyphenylproprionic acid increase over time, while those for lipoic acid and methane metabolism pathways decrease, patterns that are linked to beneficial immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, our study provides unprecedented insights into major taxonomic and functional shifts in the developing gut microbiota of infants at risk of CD linking genetic and environmental risk factors to detrimental immunomodulatory and inflammatory effects.

    "title": "Gut Microbiome Influences the Efficacy of PD-1 Antibody Immunotherapy on MSS-Type Colorectal Cancer via Metabolic Pathway.",
    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) appears to be rather refractory to checkpoint blockers except the patient with deficient in mismatch repair (dMMR). Therefore, new advances in the treatment of most mismatch repair proficiency (pMMR) (also known as microsatellite stability, MSS) type of CRC patients are considered to be an important clinical issue associated with programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of gut microbiome of MSS-type CRC tumor-bearing mice treated with different antibiotics on PD-1 antibody immunotherapy response. Our results confirmed that the gut microbiome played a key role in the treatment of CT26 tumor-bearing mice with PD-1 antibody. After PD-1 antibody treatment, the injection of antibiotics counteracted the efficacy of PD-1 antibody in inhibiting tumor growth when compared with the Control group (mice were treated with sterile drinking water). Bacteroides_sp._CAG:927 and Bacteroidales_S24-7 were enriched in Control group. Bacteroides_sp._CAG:927, Prevotella_sp._CAG: 1031 and Bacteroides were enriched in Coli group [mice were treated with colistin (2 mg/ml)], Prevotella_sp._CAG:485 and Akkermansia_muciniphila were enriched in Vanc group [mice were treated with vancomycin alone (0.25 mg/ml)]. The metabolites were enriched in the glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway consistent with the metagenomic prediction pathway in Vanc group, Prevotella_sp._CAG:485 and Akkermansia may maintain the normal efficacy of PD-1 antibody by affecting the metabolism of glycerophospholipid. Changes in gut microbiome leaded to changes in glycerophospholipid metabolism level, which may affect the expression of immune-related cytokines IFN-γ and IL-2 in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in a different therapeutic effect of PD-1 antibody. Our findings show that changes in the gut microbiome affect the glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway, thereby regulating the therapeutic potential of PD-1 antibody in the immunotherapy of MSS-type CRC tumor-bearing mice.",

    "abstract": "Several studies based on 16SrDNA analysis have revealed certain unique characteristics of gut microbiome in centenarians. We established a prospective cohort of fecal microbiota and conducted the first metagenomics-based study among centenarians. The objective was to explore the dynamic changes of gut microbiota in healthy centenarians and centenarians approaching end of life and to unravel the characteristics of aging-associated microbiome. Seventy-five healthy centenarians residing in three regions of Hainan participated in follow-up surveys and collection of fecal samples at intervals of 3 months. Data pertaining to dietary status, health status scores, cause of disease and death, and fecal specimens were collected for 15 months. Twenty participants died within 20 months during the follow-up period. The median survival time was 8-9 months (range, 1-17) and the mortality rate was 14.7% per year. The health status scores before death were significantly lower than those at 3 months before the end of the follow-up period [median score: 3 (range, 1-5), <i>P</i> < 0.05]. At this time, the participants mainly exhibited symptoms of anorexia and reduced dietary intake and physical activity. Metagenomics sequencing and analysis were carried out to characterize the gut microbiota changes in the centenarians during their transition from healthy status to death. Anosim analysis showed a significant change in gut microbiota from 7 months prior to death (<i>R</i> = 0.10, <i>P</i> = 0.02). All participants were grouped with 7 months before death as cut-off; no significant difference in α diversity was found between the two groups (<i>P</i> = 0.45). Semi-supervised monitoring and log rank sum analysis revealed significant changes in the abundance of ten bacterial species before death; of these, eight species were significantly reduced (<i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, <i>Alistipes finegoldii</i>, <i>Alistipes shahii</i>, <i>Bacteroides faecis</i>, <i>Bacteroides intestinalis</i>, <i>Butyrivibrio crossotus</i>, <i>Bacteroides stercoris</i>, and <i>Prevotella stercorea</i>) while two were significantly increased before death (<i>Bifidobacterium longum</i> and <i>Ruminococcus bromii</i>). Compared to centenarians in northern Italy, Hainan centenarians exhibited unique characteristics of gut microbiome. The abundance of ten bacterial species showed significant changes starting from 7 months before death. We speculate that these changes might occur before the clinical symptoms of deterioration in health status.",

A pressing need is the ability to assign specific functions in terms of enzymes and small molecules to specific taxa or groups of taxa in the community. This knowledge will be crucial for advancing personalized therapies based on the targeted modulation of microbes or metabolites that have predictable outcomes to benefit the human host.

    "title": "Gut Microbiota Composition Changes in Constipated Women of Reproductive Age.",
    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Chronic constipation is one of the most prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorders, yet its etiology is multifactorial, and the pathophysiological mechanism is still unclear. Previous studies have shown that the gut microbiota of constipated patients differs from healthy controls; however, many discrepancies exist in the findings, and no clear link has been confirmed between chronic constipation and changes in the gut microbiota. Growing evidence indicates that age, gender, and hormone levels can affect the composition of gut microbiota. The aim of this study is to examine the overall changes in gut microbiota within a specific sub-population of patients, namely, constipated women of reproductive age.<h4>Methods</h4>We carried out a cross-sectional study comparing the fecal microbial composition of 30 healthy women and 29 constipated women using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Only women of reproductive age were recruited to reduce the effects of age, gender, and hormone levels on the microbiome, and to prevent conflating the impact of these factors with the effects of constipation.<h4>Results</h4>There were obvious differences in the gut microbiota in constipated women of reproductive age compared with the healthy controls, manifesting mainly as a significant increase in the abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i> (p < 0.05) and a significant decrease in the abundance of Proteobacteria (p < 0.01). The overall composition of the gut microbiota in each group was different, which was reflected in the ratios of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B), which was 1.52 in the constipated group vs. 2.21 in the healthy group. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria, like <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Fusicatenibacter</i> (p < 0.01).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The overall composition of the gut microbiota changed in constipated women of reproductive age, characterized by a loss in Proteobacteria and an increase in Bacteroidetes. Furthermore, the abundance of some butyrate-producing bacteria also reduced. These changes may reflect the unique interactions between host and some bacteria, or some bacterial metabolic products, which may be important targets for future studies to explore the pathogenesis of constipation.",

Diet-induced changes in gut-microbiome are recently supposed to contribute on epidemics of CRC. This study was aimed to investigate the association of metagenomics and metabolomics in gut extracellular vesicles (EVs) of CRC and healthy subjects. A total of 40 healthy volunteers and 32 patients with CRC were enrolled in this study. Metagenomic profiling by sequencing 16 S rDNA was performed for assessing microbial codiversity. We explored the small molecule metabolites using gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In total, stool EVs were prepared from 40 healthy volunteers and 32 patients with CRC. Metagenomic profiling demonstrated that bacterial phyla, particularly of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, were significantly altered in patients with colorectal cancer. Through metabolomics profiling, we determined seven amino acids, four carboxylic acids, and four fatty acids; including short-chain to long chain fatty acids that altered in the disease group. Binary logistic regression was further tested to evaluate the diagnostic performance. In summary, the present findings suggest that gut flora dysbiosis may result in alternation of amino acid metabolism, which may be correlated with the pathogenesis of CRC.",

The analysis of fecal community diversity with 16S rDNA sequencing showed an obvious change in microbial structure of ALS patients, where Bacteroidetes at the phylum level and several microbes at the genus level were up-regulated, while Firmicutes at the phylum level and Megamonas at the genus level were down-regulated compared to healthy controls. Additionally, decreased gene function associated with metabolic pathways was observed in ALS patients. The metagenomics further demonstrated the discrepancies in microflora at the species level and relevant metabolites thereof were also revealed when combined with metabolomics. In conclusion, the altered composition of the gut microbiota and metabolic products in ALS patients provided deeper insights into the pathogenesis of ALS, and these biomarkers might be established as potential therapeutic targets which deserve further exploration.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence has suggested the association of the gut microbiome with some human diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this study, we analyzed the gut microbiota from a cohort of healthy and diabetic Chinese individuals from Northern China. Pyrosequencing of the V4V5 region of 16S rRNA genes revealed a significant decrease in the gut microbiota diversity of diabetic patients as compared to healthy individuals. Butyrate-producing bacteria such as Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia were significantly decreased in diabetic patients. Furthermore, the abundance of Dorea was significantly increased in T2D individuals and negatively correlated with the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria. The increase of Dorea could play a role in the development of T2D and has been previously overlooked. Importantly, functional analysis of the gut microbiome revealed for the first time that increased levels of butyrate production via transferases and the degradation of several amino acids due to gut microbial metabolism have strong correlations with T2D in Northern China. Moreover, the potential of gut microbiota-based classifiers to identify individuals with a high risk for T2D has been demonstrated in this study. Taken together, our findings have revealed a previously unappreciated association of the gut microbiome with T2D and have also suggested that changes in gut microbiota may be used to identify individuals at high risk for T2D.",

In particular, diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) and depression exhibit similar fecal microbiota signatures, yet little is known about their pathogenic mechanism. Here, we propose that the differences in structure and composition of IBS-D and depression gut microbiota give rise to different downstream functions, which lead to distinct clinical phenotypes <i>via</i> host metabolism and further influence the interaction of brain-gut axis.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed multiomics study, including fecal metagenome-wide sequencing and serum metabolomics profiling in 65 individuals with IBS-D (n=22), depression (n=15), comorbid patients (n=13), and healthy controls (n=15). We analyzed functional genes contributed by the primary genus and evaluated their correlations with clinical indices and host metabolites.<h4>Results</h4>Metagenomic analysis revealed 26 clusters of orthologous groups of protein (COG) categories consisting of a total of 4,631 functional genes. Trehalose and maltose hydrolase (COG1554) and fucose permease (COG0738) were the most relevant and enriched functional genes in the IBS-D patients; urease accessory proteins UreE (COG2371) was that in the depression patients. Context based genome annotation suggest that an alteration of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i> in IBS-D and depression respectively may be responsible for the enrichment described above. Correlation with host metabolites, such as maltotriose and isomaltose in carbohydrate metabolism and anandamide in neuroactive metabolism, drew further connections between these findings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These changes led us to propose a connection between genomic signatures and clinical differences observed in IBS-D and depression.

    "abstract": "Gut microbial and metabolite alterations have been linked to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. Here we perform a multi-omics microbiome and metabolite analysis of a longitudinal cohort of Crohn's disease patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and investigational therapy that induces drug free remission in a subset of patients. Via comparison of patients who responded and maintained remission, responded but experienced disease relapse and patients who did not respond to therapy, we identify shared functional signatures that correlate with disease activity despite the variability of gut microbiota profiles at taxonomic level. These signatures reflect the disease state when transferred to gnotobiotic mice. Taken together, the integration of microbiome and metabolite profiles from human cohort and mice improves the predictive modelling of disease outcome, and allows the identification of a network of bacteria-metabolite interactions involving sulfur metabolism as a key mechanism linked to disease activity in Crohn's disease.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is a current and expanding threat to the practice of modern medicine. Antibiotic therapy has been shown to perturb the composition of the host microbiome with significant health consequences. In addition, the gut microbiome is known to be a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes. Work has demonstrated that antibiotics can alter the collection of antibiotic resistance genes within the microbiome through selection and horizontal gene transfer. While antibiotics also have the potential to impact the expression of resistance genes, metagenomic-based pipelines currently lack the ability to detect these shifts. Here, we utilized a dual sequencing approach combining shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to profile how three antibiotics, amoxicillin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin, impact the murine gut resistome at the DNA and RNA level. We found that each antibiotic induced broad, but untargeted impacts on the gene content of the resistome. In contrast, changes in ARG transcript abundance were more targeted to the antibiotic treatment. Doxycycline and amoxicillin induced the expression of tetracycline and beta-lactamase resistance genes, respectively. Furthermore, the increased beta-lactamase resistance gene transcripts could contribute to an observed bloom of <i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i> during amoxicillin treatment. Based on these findings, we propose that the utilization of a dual sequencing methodology provides a unique capacity to fully understand the response of the resistome to antibiotic perturbation. In particular, the analysis of transcripts reveals that the expression and utilization of resistance genes is far narrower than their abundance at the genomic level would suggest.",

Human gut metagenomic analysis revealed that responder patients had significantly higher microbial diversity and different microbiota compositions compared to non-responders. A machine-learning model was developed and validated in an independent cohort to predict treatment outcomes based on gut microbiota composition and functional repertoires of responders and non-responders. Specific species, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides xylanisolvens, were positively correlated with treatment outcomes. Oral gavage of these responder bacteria significantly increased the efficacy of erlotinib and induced the expression of CXCL9 and IFN-γ in a murine lung cancer model. These data suggest a predictable impact of specific constituents of the microbiota on tumor growth and cancer treatment outcomes with implications for both prognosis and therapy.",

Nevertheless, the vast heterogeneity of study designs and microbial community profiling strategies, and of bioinformatic and biostatistical approaches for analyses of metagenomic sequence datasets hinder the identification of bacterial targets for follow-up experimental investigations of helminth-microbiota cross-talk. Furthermore, comparative analyses of published datasets are made difficult by the unavailability of a unique repository for metagenomic sequence data and associated metadata linked to studies aimed to explore potential changes in the composition of the vertebrate gut microbiota in response to GI and/or EI helminth infections.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we undertake a meta-analysis of available metagenomic sequence data linked to published studies on helminth-microbiota cross-talk in humans and veterinary species using a single bioinformatic pipeline, and introduce the 'MICrobiome HELminth INteractions database' (MICHELINdb), an online resource for mining of published sequence datasets, and corresponding metadata, generated in these investigations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By increasing data accessibility, we aim to provide the scientific community with a platform to identify gut microbial populations with potential roles in the pathophysiology of helminth disease and parasite-mediated suppression of host inflammatory responses, and facilitate the design of experiments aimed to disentangle the cause(s) and effect(s) of helminth-microbiota relationships.

    "abstract": "The population cycles of small rodents have puzzled biologists for centuries. There is a growing recognition of the cascading effects of climate change on the population dynamics of rodents. However, the ultimate cause for the bottom-up effects of precipitation is poorly understood, from a microbial perspective. Here, we conducted a precipitation manipulation experiment in the field, and three feeding trials with controlled diets in the laboratory. We found precipitation supplementation facilitated the recovery of a perennial rhizomatous grass (Leymus chinensis) species, which altered the diet composition and increase the intake of fructose and fructooligosaccharides for Brandt's vole. Lab results showed that this nutrient shift was accompanied by the modulation of gut microbiota composition and functional pathways (especially for the degradation or biosynthesis of L-histidine). Particularly, the relative abundance of Eubacterium hallii was consistently increased after feeding voles with more L. chinensis, fructose or fructooligosaccharide. These modulations ultimately increased the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and boosted the growth of vole. This study provides evidence that the precipitation pulses cascades through the plant community to affect rodent gut microbiome. Our results highlight the importance of considering host-microbiota interaction when investigating rodent population responses to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Preterm infants are exposed to major perinatal, post-natal, and early infancy events that could impact on the gut microbiome. These events include infection, steroid and antibiotic exposure, parenteral nutrition, necrotizing enterocolitis, and stress. Studies have shown that there are differences in the gut microbiome during the early months of life in preterm infants. We hypothesized that differences in the gut microbial composition and metabolites in children born very preterm persist into mid-childhood. Participants were healthy prepubertal children aged 5-11 years who were born very preterm (≤32 weeks of gestation; <i>n</i> = 51) or at term (37-41 weeks; <i>n</i> = 50). We recorded the gestational age, birth weight, mode of feeding, mode of birth, age, sex, and the current height and weight of our cohort. We performed a multi'omics [i.e., 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, SPME-GCMS (solid-phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry)] analysis to investigate the structure and function of the fecal microbiome (as a proxy of the gut microbiota) in our cross-sectional cohort. Children born very preterm were younger (7.8 vs. 8.3 years; <i>p</i> = 0.034), shorter [height-standard deviation score (SDS) 0.31 vs. 0.92; <i>p</i> = 0.0006) and leaner [BMI (body mass index) SDS -0.20 vs. 0.29; <i>p</i> < 0.0001] than the term group. Children born very preterm had higher fecal calprotectin levels, decreased fecal phage richness, lower plasma arginine, lower fecal branched-chain amino acids and higher fecal volatile (i.e., 3-methyl-butanoic acid, butyrolactone, butanoic acid and pentanoic acid) profiles. The bacterial microbiomes did not differ between preterm and term groups. We speculate that the observed very preterm-specific changes were established in early infancy and may impact on the capacity of the very preterm children to respond to environmental changes.",

In this study, the gut bacterial, fungal, and viral metagenomic composition was assessed from three <i>Panthera</i> species (lion, leopard, and tiger) of Indian origin, which were consuming the same diet and belonged to the same geographical location. A non-redundant bacterial gene catalog of the <i>Panthera</i> gut consisting of 1,507,035 putative genes was constructed from 27 <i>Panthera</i> individuals, which revealed a higher abundance of purine metabolism genes correlating with their purine-rich dietary intake. Analysis with Carbohydrate Active enZyme (CAZy) and MEROPS databases identified enrichment of glycoside hydrolases (GHs), glycoside-transferases, and collagenases in the gut, which are important for nutrient acquisition from animal biomass. The bacterial, fungal, and viral community analysis provided the first comprehensive insights into the <i>Panthera</i>-specific microbial community. The <i>Panthera</i> gene catalog and the largest comparative study of the gut bacterial composition of 68 individuals of Carnivora species from different geographical locations and diet underscore the role of diet and geography in shaping the <i>Panthera</i> gut microbiome, which is significant for the health and conservation management of these highly endangered species.",

    "abstract": "It has been well acknowledged that the gut microbiome is important for host health, composition changes in these microbial communities might increase susceptibility to infections and reduce adaptability to environment. Reintroduction, as an effective strategy for wild population recovery and genetic diversity maintenance for endangered populations, usually takes captive populations as rewilding resource. While, little is known about the compositional and functional differences of gut microbiota between captive and wild populations, especially for large carnivores, like Amur tiger. In this study, high throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene (amplicon sequencing) and metagenomics were used to analyze the composition and function variations of gut microbiota communities between captive and wild Amur tiger populations based on total 35 fecal samples (13 from captive tigers and 22 from wild tigers). Our results showed that captive Amur tigers have higher alpha diversity in gut microbiota, but that the average unweighted UniFrac distance of bacterial taxa among wild Amur tigers was much larger. The function differences involve most aspects of the body functions, especially for metabolism, environmental information processing, cellular processes, and organismal systems. It was indicated that the diet habit and environment difference between captive and wild populations lead to composition differences of gut microbiota and then resulted in significant differences in functions. These contrasts of functional and compositional variations in gut microbiota between wild and captive Amur tigers are essential insights for guiding conservation management and policy decision-making, and call for more attention on the influence of gut microbiota on the ability of captive animals to survive in the wild.",

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled intervention clinical trial to assess the safety (primary endpoint) of and gut microbiota response (secondary endpoint) to the daily ingestion for 4 weeks of two doses (1 or 3 bottles/day) of a fermented milk product (Test) in 96 healthy adults. The Test product is a multi-strain fermented milk product, combining yogurt strains and probiotic candidate strains Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei CNCM I-1518 and CNCM I-3689 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690. We assessed the safety of the Test product on the following parameters: adverse events, vital signs, hematological and metabolic profile, hepatic, kidney or thyroid function, inflammatory markers, bowel habits and digestive symptoms. We explored the longitudinal gut microbiota response to product consumption and dose, by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and functional contribution by shotgun metagenomics. Safety results did not show any significant difference between the Test and Control products whatever the parameters assessed, at the two doses ingested daily over a 4-week-period. Probiotic candidate strains were detected only during consumption period, and at a significantly higher level for the three strains in subjects who consumed 3 products bottles/day. The global structure of the gut microbiota as assessed by alpha and beta-diversity, was not altered by consumption of the product for four weeks. A zero-inflated beta regression model with random effects (ZIBR) identified a few bacterial genera with differential responses to test product consumption dose compared to control.

    "title": "Potential Elimination of Human Gut Resistome by Exploiting the Benefits of Functional Foods.",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in technology over the last decades have strived to elucidate the diverse and abundant ecosystem of the human microbiome. The intestinal microbiota represents a densely inhabited environment that offers a plethora of beneficial effects to the host's wellbeing. On the other hand, it can serve as a potential reservoir of Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) bacteria and their antibiotic-resistant genes (ARgenes), which comprise the \"gut resistome.\" ARgenes, like antibiotics, have been omnipresent in the environment for billions of years. In the context of the gut microbiome, these genes may conflate into exogenous MDR or emerge in commensals due to mutations or gene transfers. It is currently generally accepted that Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) poses a serious threat to public health worldwide. It is of paramount importance that researchers focus on, amongst other parameters, elaborating strategies to manage the gut resistome, particularly focusing on the diminution of AMR. Potential interventions in the gut microbiome field by Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) or functional foods are newly emerged candidates for the uprooting of MDR strains and restoring dysbiosis and resilience. Probiotic nutrition is thought to diminish gut colonization from pathobionts. Yet only a few studies have explored the effects of antibiotics use on the reservoir of AR genes and the demanding time for return to normal by gut microbiota-targeted strategies. Regular administration of probiotic bacteria has recently been linked to restoration of the gut ecosystem and decrease of the gut resistome and AR genes carriers. This review summarizes the latest information about the intestinal resistome and the intriguing methods of fighting against AMR through probiotic-based methods and gut microbial shifts that have been proposed. This study contains some key messages: (1) AMR currently poses a lethal threat to global health, and it is pivotal for the scientific community to do its utmost in fighting against it; (2) human gut microbiome research, within the last decade especially, seems to be preoccupied with the interface of numerous diseases and identifying a potential target for a variety of interventions; (3) the gut resistome, comprised of AR genesis, presents very early on in life and is prone to shifts due to the use of antibiotics or dietary supplements; and (4) future strategies involving functional foods seem promising for the battle against AMR through intestinal resistome diminution.",

Although the cellulolytic bacteria in the yak rumen have been reported, there is still limited information on the diversity of the major microorganisms and putative carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes for the degradation of complex lignocellulosic biomass in its gut ecosystem.<h4>Results</h4>Here, this study aimed to decode biomass-degrading genes and genomes in the yak fecal microbiota using deep metagenome sequencing. A comprehensive catalog comprising 4.5 million microbial genes from the yak feces were established based on metagenomic assemblies from 92 Gb sequencing data. We identified a full spectrum of genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes, three-quarters of which were assigned to highly diversified enzyme families involved in the breakdown of complex dietary carbohydrates, including 120 families of glycoside hydrolases, 25 families of polysaccharide lyases, and 15 families of carbohydrate esterases. Inference of taxonomic assignments to the carbohydrate-degrading genes revealed the major microbial contributors were Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Prevotellaceae. Furthermore, 68 prokaryotic genomes were reconstructed and the genes encoding glycoside hydrolases involved in plant-derived polysaccharide degradation were identified in these uncultured genomes, many of which were novel species with lignocellulolytic capability.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings shed light on a great diversity of carbohydrate-degrading enzymes in the yak gut microbial community and uncultured species, which provides a useful genetic resource for future studies on the discovery of novel enzymes for industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Human gut microbiome is a promising target for managing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Measures altering gut microbiota like oral intake of probiotics or berberine (BBR), a bacteriostatic agent, merit metabolic homoeostasis. We hence conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with newly diagnosed T2D patients from 20 centres in China. Four-hundred-nine eligible participants were enroled, randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) and completed a 12-week treatment of either BBR-alone, probiotics+BBR, probiotics-alone, or placebo, after a one-week run-in of gentamycin pretreatment. The changes in glycated haemoglobin, as the primary outcome, in the probiotics+BBR (least-squares mean [95% CI], -1.04[-1.19, -0.89]%) and BBR-alone group (-0.99[-1.16, -0.83]%) were significantly greater than that in the placebo and probiotics-alone groups (-0.59[-0.75, -0.44]%, -0.53[-0.68, -0.37]%, P < 0.001). BBR treatment induced more gastrointestinal side effects. Further metagenomics and metabolomic studies found that the hypoglycaemic effect of BBR is mediated by the inhibition of DCA biotransformation by Ruminococcus bromii. Therefore, our study reports a human microbial related mechanism underlying the antidiabetic effect of BBR on T2D. (Clinicaltrial.gov Identifier: NCT02861261).",

    "abstract": "Gut mucosal microbes evolved closest to the host, developing specialized local communities. There is, however, insufficient knowledge of these communities as most studies have employed sequencing technologies to investigate faecal microbiota only. This work used shotgun metagenomics of mucosal biopsies to explore the microbial communities' compositions of terminal ileum and large intestine in 5 healthy individuals. Functional annotations and genome-scale metabolic modelling of selected species were then employed to identify local functional enrichments. While faecal metagenomics provided a good approximation of the average gut mucosal microbiome composition, mucosal biopsies allowed detecting the subtle variations of local microbial communities. Given their significant enrichment in the mucosal microbiota, we highlight the roles of Bacteroides species and describe the antimicrobial resistance biogeography along the intestine. We also detail which species, at which locations, are involved with the tryptophan/indole pathway, whose malfunctioning has been linked to pathologies including inflammatory bowel disease. Our study thus provides invaluable resources for investigating mechanisms connecting gut microbiota and host pathophysiology.",

    "title": "Gut microbiota steroid sexual dimorphism and its impact on gonadal steroids: influences of obesity and menopausal status.",
    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Gonadal steroid hormones have been suggested as the underlying mechanism responsible for the sexual dimorphism observed in metabolic diseases. Animal studies have also evidenced a causal role of the gut microbiome and metabolic health. However, the role of sexual dimorphism in the gut microbiota and the potential role of the microbiome in influencing sex steroid hormones and shaping sexually dimorphic susceptibility to disease have been largely overlooked. Although there is some evidence of sex-specific differences in the gut microbiota diversity, composition, and functionality, the results are inconsistent. Importantly, most of these studies have not taken into account the gonadal steroid status. Therefore, we investigated the gut microbiome composition and functionality in relation to sex, menopausal status, and circulating sex steroids.<h4>Results</h4>No significant differences were found in alpha diversity indices among pre- and post-menopausal women and men, but beta diversity differed among groups. The gut microbiota from post-menopausal women was more similar to men than to pre-menopausal women. Metagenome functional analyses revealed no significant differences between post-menopausal women and men. Gonadal steroids were specifically associated with these differences. Hence, the gut microbiota of pre-menopausal women was more enriched in genes from the steroid biosynthesis and degradation pathways, with the former having the strongest fold change among all associated pathways. Microbial steroid pathways also had significant associations with the plasma levels of testosterone and progesterone. In addition, a specific microbiome signature was able to predict the circulating testosterone levels at baseline and after 1-year follow-up. In addition, this microbiome signature could be transmitted from humans to antibiotic-induced microbiome-depleted male mice, being able to predict donor's testosterone levels 4 weeks later, implying that the microbiota profile of the recipient mouse was influenced by the donor's gender. Finally, obesity eliminated most of the differences observed among non-obese pre-menopausal women, post-menopausal women, and men in the gut microbiota composition (Bray-Curtis and weighted unifrac beta diversity), functionality, and the gonadal steroid status.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present findings evidence clear differences in the gut microbial composition and functionality between men and women, which is eliminated by both menopausal and obesity status. We also reveal a tight link between the gut microbiota composition and the circulating levels of gonadal steroids, particularly testosterone. Video Abstract.",

Few studies have reported the dominance of methanogens in the archaeal microbiome (archaeome) of the human gut, although limited information regarding the diversity and abundance of other archaeal phylotypes is available.<h4>Results</h4>We surveyed the archaeome of faecal samples collected from 897 East Asian subjects living in South Korea. In total, 42.47% faecal samples were positive for archaeal colonisation; these were subsequently subjected to archaeal 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based abundance estimation. The mean archaeal relative abundance was 10.24 ± 4.58% of the total bacterial and archaeal abundance. We observed extensive colonisation of haloarchaea (95.54%) in the archaea-positive faecal samples, with 9.63% mean relative abundance in archaeal communities. Haloarchaea were relatively more abundant than methanogens in some samples. The presence of haloarchaea was also verified by fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis. Owing to large inter-individual variations, we categorised the human gut archaeome into four archaeal enterotypes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The study demonstrated that the human gut archaeome is indigenous, responsive, and functional, expanding our understanding of the archaeal signature in the gut of human individuals.

    "abstract": "Tibetan pig is an important domestic mammal, providing products of high nutritional value for millions of people living in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The genomes of mammalian gut microbiota encode a large number of carbohydrate-active enzymes, which are essential for the digestion of complex polysaccharides through fermentation. However, the current understanding of microbial degradation of dietary carbohydrates in the Tibetan pig gut is limited. In this study, we produced approximately 145 gigabases of metagenomic sequence data for the fecal samples from 11 Tibetan pigs. <i>De novo</i> assembly and binning recovered 322 metagenome-assembled genomes taxonomically assigned to 11 bacterial phyla and two archaeal phyla. Of these genomes, 191 represented the uncultivated microbes derived from novel prokaryotic taxa. Twenty-three genomes were identified as metagenomic biomarkers that were significantly abundant in the gut ecosystem of Tibetan pigs compared to the other low-altitude relatives. Further, over 13,000 carbohydrate-degrading genes were identified, and these genes were more abundant in some of the genomes within the five principal phyla: <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, <i>Spirochaetota</i>, <i>Verrucomicrobiota</i>, and <i>Fibrobacterota</i>. Particularly, three genomes representing the uncultivated <i>Verrucomicrobiota</i> encode the most abundant degradative enzymes in the fecal microbiota of Tibetan pigs. These findings should substantially increase the phylogenetic diversity of specific taxonomic clades in the microbial tree of life and provide an expanded repertoire of biomass-degrading genes for future application to microbial production of industrial enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is closely related to gut microbiota, which may be significantly affected by ethnicity and the environment. Knowledge regarding the gut microbiome of Tibetan CHD patients living in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is very limited. In this study, we characterized the physiological parameters and gut microbiota from 23 healthy Tibetans (HT), 18 CHD patients, and 12 patients with non-stenosis coronary heart disease (NCHD). We analyzed the alterations of the gut microbiome in CHD patients and investigated the relationship between these alterations and the pathological indicators. We found no changes in trimethylamine N-oxide, however, a significant increase in lipopolysaccharides and white blood cells, and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein were observed in the blood of CHD patients, compared to that in the HT group. The gut microbiota of the NCHD group had a significantly higher Shannon index than that of the HT group. Adonis analysis showed that both microbial compositions and functions of the three groups were significantly separated. The <i>Dialister</i> genus was significantly lower and <i>Blautia, Desulfovibrio</i>, and <i>Succinivibrio</i> were significantly higher in abundance in CHD patients compared with the HT group, and the changes were significantly correlated with physiological indexes, such as increased lipopolysaccharides. Moreover, enrichment of genes decreased in four pathways of amino acid metabolism, such as arginine biosynthesis and histidine metabolism, although two lipid metabolism pathways, including fatty acid degradation and arachidonic acid metabolism, increased in the CHD group. Additionally, occupation and a family history of CHD were shown to be risk factors and affected the gut microbiota in Tibetans. Our study will provide insights into the understanding of CHD, leading to better diagnosis and treatment of Tibetan patients.",

    "abstract": "Although the taxonomic composition of the human microbiome varies tremendously across individuals, its gene composition or functional capacity is highly conserved - implying an ecological property known as functional redundancy. Such functional redundancy has been hypothesized to underlie the stability and resilience of the human microbiome, but this hypothesis has never been quantitatively tested. The origin of functional redundancy is still elusive. Here, we investigate the basis for functional redundancy in the human microbiome by analyzing its genomic content network - a bipartite graph that links microbes to the genes in their genomes. We find that this network exhibits several topological features that favor high functional redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a simple genome evolution model to generate genomic content network, finding that moderate selection pressure and high horizontal gene transfer rate are necessary to generate genomic content networks with key topological features that favor high functional redundancy. Finally, we analyze data from two published studies of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), finding that high functional redundancy of the recipient's pre-FMT microbiota raises barriers to donor microbiota engraftment. This work elucidates the potential ecological and evolutionary processes that create and maintain functional redundancy in the human microbiome and contribute to its resilience.",

    "title": "New Frontiers of Anaerobic Hydrocarbon Biodegradation in the Multi-Omics Era.",
    "abstract": "The accumulation of petroleum hydrocarbons in the environment substantially endangers terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Many microbial strains have been recognized to utilize aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons under aerobic conditions. Nevertheless, most of these pollutants are transferred by natural processes, including rain, into the underground anaerobic zones where their degradation is much more problematic. In oxic zones, anaerobic microenvironments can be formed as a consequence of the intensive respiratory activities of (facultative) aerobic microbes. Even though aerobic bioremediation has been well-characterized over the past few decades, ample research is yet to be done in the field of anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation. With the emergence of high-throughput techniques, known as omics (e.g., genomics and metagenomics), the individual biodegraders, hydrocarbon-degrading microbial communities and metabolic pathways, interactions can be described at a contaminated site. Omics approaches provide the opportunity to examine single microorganisms or microbial communities at the system level and elucidate the metabolic networks, interspecies interactions during hydrocarbon mineralization. Metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics, for example, can shed light on the active genes and proteins and functional importance of the less abundant species. Moreover, novel unculturable hydrocarbon-degrading strains and enzymes can be discovered and fit into the metabolic networks of the community. Our objective is to review the anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation processes, the most important hydrocarbon degraders and their diverse metabolic pathways, including the use of various terminal electron acceptors and various electron transfer processes. The review primarily focuses on the achievements obtained by the current high-throughput (multi-omics) techniques which opened new perspectives in understanding the processes at the system level including the metabolic routes of individual strains, metabolic/electric interaction of the members of microbial communities. Based on the multi-omics techniques, novel metabolic blocks can be designed and used for the construction of microbial strains/consortia for efficient removal of hydrocarbons in anaerobic zones.",

    "abstract": "Metabolomic analyses of human gut microbiome samples can unveil the metabolic potential of host tissues and the numerous microorganisms they support, concurrently. As such, metabolomic information bears immense potential to improve disease diagnosis and therapeutic drug discovery. Unfortunately, as cohort sizes increase, comprehensive metabolomic profiling becomes costly and logistically difficult to perform at a large scale. To address these difficulties, we tested the feasibility of predicting the metabolites of a microbial community based solely on microbiome sequencing data. Paired microbiome sequencing (16S rRNA gene amplicons, shotgun metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics) and metabolome (mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) datasets were collected from six independent studies spanning multiple diseases. We used these datasets to evaluate two reference-based gene-to-metabolite prediction pipelines and a machine-learning (ML) based metabolic profile prediction approach. With the pre-trained model on over 900 microbiome-metabolome paired samples, the ML approach yielded the most accurate predictions (i.e., highest F1 scores) of metabolite occurrences in the human gut and outperformed reference-based pipelines in predicting differential metabolites between case and control subjects. Our findings demonstrate the possibility of predicting metabolites from microbiome sequencing data, while highlighting certain limitations in detecting differential metabolites, and provide a framework to evaluate metabolite prediction pipelines, which will ultimately facilitate future investigations on microbial metabolites and human health.",

We explored the effect of the intestinal microbiota on osteoporosis.<h4>Methods</h4>We constructed a postmenopausal osteoporosis mouse model, and Micro CT was used to observe changes in bone structure. Then, we identified the abundance of intestinal microbiota by 16S RNA sequencing and found that the ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes increased significantly. UHPLC-MS analysis was further used to analyze changes in metabolites in feces and serum.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 53 upregulated and 61 downregulated metabolites in feces and 2 upregulated and 22 downregulated metabolites in serum under OP conditions, and interestedly, one group of bile acids showed significant differences in the OP and control groups. Network analysis also found that these bile acids had a strong relationship with the same family, Eggerthellaceae. Random forest analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the serum and fecal models in distinguishing the OP group from the control group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results indicated that changes in the gut microbiota and metabolites in feces and serum were responsible for the occurrence and development of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

The human gut microbial composition is known to be altered in disease conditions. Considering the important role of the gut microbiome in maintaining homeostasis and overall health, it is important to understand the microbial diversity and the functional metagenome of the healthy gut. Here, we characterized the microbiota of 31 fecal samples from healthy individuals of Indian ethnic tribes from Ladakh, Jaisalmer and Khargone by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Sequence analysis revealed that Bifidobacterium and Prevotella were the key microbes contributing to the differences among Jaisalmer, Khargone and Ladakh samples at the genus level. Our correlation network study identified carbohydrate-active enzymes and carbohydrate binding proteins that are associated with specific genera in the different Indian geographical regions studied. Network analysis of carbohydrate-active enzymes and genus abundance revealed that the presence of different carbohydrate-active enzymes is driven by differential abundance of genera. The correlation networks were different in the different geographical regions, and these interactions suggest the role of less abundant genera in shaping the gut environment. We compared our data with samples from different countries and found significant differences in taxonomic composition and abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes in the gut microbiota as compared to the other countries.",

    "abstract": "Milk products are an important component of human diets, with beneficial effects for human health, but also one of the major sources of nutritionally undesirable saturated fatty acids (SFA). Recent discoveries showing the importance of the rumen microbiome on dairy cattle health, metabolism and performance highlight that milk composition, and potentially milk SFA content, may also be associated with microorganisms, their genes and their activities. Understanding these mechanisms can be used for the development of cost-effective strategies for the production of milk with less SFA. This work aimed to compare the rumen microbiome between cows producing milk with contrasting FA profile and identify potentially responsible metabolic-related microbial mechanisms. Forty eight Holstein dairy cows were fed the same total mixed ration under the same housing conditions. Milk and rumen fluid samples were collected from all cows for the analysis of fatty acid profiles (by gas chromatography), the abundances of rumen microbiome communities and genes (by whole-genome-shotgun metagenomics), and rumen metabolome (using 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance). The following groups: (i) 24 High-SFA (66.9-74.4% total FA) vs. 24 Low-SFA (60.2-66.6%% total FA) cows, and (ii) 8 extreme High-SFA (69.9-74.4% total FA) vs. 8 extreme Low-SFA (60.2-64.0% total FA) were compared. Rumen of cows producing milk with more SFA were characterized by higher abundances of the lactic acid bacteria <i>Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc</i>, and <i>Weissella</i>, the acetogenic Proteobacteria <i>Acetobacter</i> and <i>Kozakia, Mycobacterium</i>, two fungi (<i>Cutaneotrichosporon</i> and <i>Cyphellophora</i>), and at a lesser extent <i>Methanobrevibacter</i> and the protist <i>Nannochloropsis</i>. Cows carrying genes correlated with milk FA also had higher concentrations of butyrate, propionate and tyrosine and lower concentrations of xanthine and hypoxanthine in the rumen. Abundances of rumen microbial genes were able to explain between 76 and 94% on the variation of the most abundant milk FA. Metagenomics and metabolomics analyses highlighted that cows producing milk with contrasting FA profile under the same diet, also differ in their rumen metabolic activities in relation to adaptation to reduced rumen pH, carbohydrate fermentation, and protein synthesis and metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Periodontitis has been associated with a variety of systematic diseases via affecting gut microbiota. However, the influence of periodontal treatment on intestinal microbiota is not known. Hyperlipidemia can significantly alter gut microbiota structure. It is proposed that the presence of hyperlipidemia can influence the impact of periodontitis on microbiota. This study was conducted to explore the influence of periodontitis and periodontal treatment on the gut microbiota on the basis of hyperlipidemia. Apolipoprotein E<sup>-/-</sup>(ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>) mice were ligatured to induced periodontitis and non-surgical periodontal treatment was performed for half of them after 4 weeks of ligation. Microbiota communities in the feces collected at 4, 5, 8 weeks after ligation were investigated using next-generation sequencing of 16S rDNA. Bone loss at periodontitis sites were analyzed using micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT). Morphology and mucosal architecture injury of ileum tissue were observed with hematoxylin-eosin staining. The serum lipid levels were assayed. The results showed that β-diversity index in experimental periodontitis group was differed significantly from that of the control group. Significant differences were found in β-diversity between the non-surgical periodontal treatment group and the ligation group. The samples of the non-surgical periodontal treatment group and the control group were clustered together 4 weeks after periodontal treatment. Intestinal villus height and ratio of villus height to crypt depth was found decreased after ligation and restored after non-surgical periodontal treatment. Non-surgical periodontal treatment induced the colonization and prosper of butyrate-producing bacteria <i>Eubacterium</i>, which was absent/not present in the ligation group. We confirmed that periodontitis led to gut microbiota dysbiosis in mice with hyperlipidemia. Non-surgical periodontal treatment had the trend to normalize the gut microbiota and improved the intestinal mucosal barrier impaired by periodontitis in apoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have adjusted dietary lipid:protein ratios and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) to optimize the growth performance of Atlantic salmon. However, dietary impacts on the gut microbiome are lacking, especially under varying environmental conditions. To examine this response, post-smolt salmon (184 ± 5 g) were fed diets with lipid:protein ratios considered low (180, 570 g/kg) and high (230, 460 g/kg) along with low and high levels of n-3 LC-PUFA (7 or 14 g/kg) while fish were reared under low and high levels of dissolved oxygen (6.7 or 8.0 mg/L). At day 0, 35 and 116, digesta in the distal intestine were collected and analyzed for viable counts and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes (V4 region) using Illumina MiSeq. The reduction in oxygen had negligible effects, except on viable plate counts of total bacteria and an initial effect on beta-diversity. In contrast, the high lipid (HL) diets had an increased alpha-diversity (e.g., Shannon and Chao-1) at day 0 and day 35 whereas high n-3 diets suppressed these indices at day 116. Generally, a reduction in alpha-diversity was observed over time and an interaction between lipid:protein ratio x n-3 was found. Between diets, beta-diversity and phyla abundance were similar as both Proteobacteria (44%) and Firmicutes (21%) dominated. However, at the genus level <i>Aliivibrio</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, Weissella, and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, were associated with low lipid (LL) diets while the high lipid diets were associated with less abundant bacteria, e.g., <i>Chromohalobacter</i>. At day 116, the relative abundance of the Tenericutes phylum increased 10-fold (36%). Fish fed the high lipid diet with high n-3 had reduced alpha-diversity, lowest abundance of lactic acid bacteria, and highest abundance of <i>Mycoplasma</i>, which may indicate a less healthy gut microbiome. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis revealed that saturated and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathways were several folds higher in fish fed the high lipid diet, possibly to compensate for the lack of dietary n-3. In summary, our results show that the viable plate counts, alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and predictive function of gut bacteria in Atlantic salmon post-smolts are influenced by dietary lipid:protein ratio and n-3 LC-PUFA over several time points with little effect by dissolved oxygen.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The dysregulation of gut microbiota is pivotal in colorectal carcinogenesis. Meanwhile, altered gut microbiome may affect the development of intestinal diseases through interaction with the host genes. However, the synergy between the altered gut microbiota composition and differential expression of specific genes in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains elusive. Thus, we integrated the data from 16S rRNA gene sequences and RNA sequences to investigate the potential relationship between genes and gut microbes in patients with CRC.<h4>Results</h4>Compared with normal samples, the presence of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria increased considerably in CRC samples; conversely, the abundance of Firmicutes and Spirochaetes decreased markedly. In particular, the genera Fusobacterium, Catenibacterium, and Shewanella were only detected in tumor samples. Meanwhile, a closely interaction between Butyricimonas and Clostridium was observed in the microbiome network. Furthermore, a total of 246 (differentially expressed genes) DEGs were identified between tumor and normal tissues. Both DEGs and microbiota were involved in bile secretion and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways. Finally, genes like cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A member 4 (CYP3A4) and ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) enriched in these two pathways were connected with the prognosis of CRC, and CRC patients with low expression level of CYP3A4 and ABCG2 had longer survival time.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Identifying the complicated interaction between gut microbiota and the DEGs contributed to further understand the pathogenesis of CRC, and these findings might enable better diagnosis and treatment of CRC patients.",

    "abstract": "Microbiota transplant is becoming a popular process to restore or initiate \"healthy\" gut microbiota and immunity. But, the potential risks of the related practices need to be carefully evaluated. This study retrospectively examined the resistomes of donated fecal microbiota for treating intestinal disorders, vaginal microbiota of pregnant women, and infant fecal microbiota from rural and urban communities, as well as the impact of transplants on the fecal resistome of human and animal recipients. Antibiotic resistance (AR) genes were found to be abundant in all donor microbiota. An overall surge of resistomes with higher prevalence and abundance of AR genes was observed in the feces of all transplanted gnotobiotic pigs as well as in the feces of infant subjects, compared to those in donor fecal and maternal vaginal microbiota. Surprisingly, transplants using rural Amish microbiota led to more instead of less AR genes in the fecal microbiota of gnotobiotic pigs than did transplants using urban microbiota. New AR gene subtypes undetected originally also appeared in gnotobiotic pigs, in Crohn's Disease (CD) patients after transplant, and in feces of infant subjects. The data illustrated the key role of the host gastrointestinal tract system in amplifying the ever-increasing AR gene pool, even without antibiotic exposure. The data further suggest that the current approaches of microbiota transplant can introduce significant health risk factor(s) to the recipients, and newborn human and animal hosts with naïve gut microbiota were especially susceptible. Given the illustrated public health risks of microbiota transplant, minimizing massive and unnecessary damages to gut microbiota by oral antibiotics and other gut impacting drugs becomes important. Since eliminating risk factors including AR bacteria and opportunistic pathogens directly from donor microbiota is still difficult to achieve, developing microbial cocktails with defined organisms and functions has further become an urgent need, should microbiota transplantation become necessary.",

We here investigated the potential associations of gut bacterial ClpB-like gene function with obesity status and gut microbiota in humans.<h4>Results</h4>Gut microbiota ClpB KEGG function was negatively associated with body mass index, waist circumference, and total fat mass (DEXA). The relative abundance (RA) of several phyla and families directly associated with ClpB was decreased in subjects with obesity. Specifically, the RA of Rikenellaceae, Clostridiaceae and not assigned Firmicutes were lower in subjects with obesity and positively associated with gut bacterial ClpB-like gene function (not assigned Firmicutes (r = 0.405, FDR = 2.93 × 10-2), Rikenellaceae (r = 0.217, FDR = 0.031), and Clostridiaceae (r = 0.239, FDR = 0.017)). The gut bacterial ClpB-like gene function was also linked to specific plasma metabolites (hippuric acid and 3-indolepropionic acid) and fecal lupeol. The α-MSH-like epitope similar to that of Escherichia coli ClpB was also identified in some sequences of those bacterial families. After fecal transplantation from humans to mice, the families that more contributed to ClpB-like gene function in humans were also associated with ClpB-like gene function in mice after adjusting for the donor's body mass index (not assigned Firmicutes (r = 0.621, p = 0.003), Prevotellaceae (r = 0.725, p = 4.1 × 10<sup>-7</sup>), Rikenellaceae (r = 0.702, p = 3.9 × 10<sup>-4</sup>), and Ruminococcaceae (r = 0.526, p = 0.014)). Clostridiaceae (r = - 0.445, p = 0.038) and Prevotellaceae RA (r = - 0.479, p = 0.024) and were also negatively associated with weight gain in mice. The absolute abundance (AA) of Prevotellaceae in mice was also positively associated with the gut bacterial ClpB-like gene function in mice. DESeq2 identified species of Prevotellaceae, both negatively associated with mice' weight gain and positively with gut bacterial ClpB-like gene function.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In summary, gut bacterial ClpB-like gene function is associated with obesity status, a specific gut microbiota composition and a plasma metabolomics profile in humans that could be partially transplanted to mice.

    "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as impaired glucose tolerance recognized during pregnancy. GDM is associated with metabolic disorder phenotypes, such as obesity, low-grade inflammation, and insulin resistance. Following delivery, nearly half of the women with a history of GDM have persistent postpartum glucose intolerance and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as much as 7-fold. The alarming upward trend may worsen the socioeconomic burden worldwide. Accumulating evidence strongly associates gut microbiota dysbiosis in women with GDM, similar to the T2DM profile. Several metagenomics studies have shown gut microbiota, such as Ruminococcaceae, <i>Parabacteroides distasonis</i>, and <i>Prevotella</i>, were enriched in women with GDM. These microbiota populations are associated with metabolic pathways for carbohydrate metabolism and insulin signaling, suggesting a potential \"gut microbiota signature\" in women with GDM. Furthermore, elevated expression of serum zonulin, a marker of gut epithelial permeability, during early pregnancy in women with GDM indicates a possible link between gut microbiota and GDM. Nevertheless, few studies have revealed discrepant results, and the interplay between gut microbiota dysbiosis and host metabolism in women with GDM is yet to be elucidated. Lifestyle modification and pharmacological treatment with metformin showed evidence of modulation of gut microbiota and proved to be beneficial to maintain glucose homeostasis in T2DM. Nonetheless, post-GDM women have poor compliance toward lifestyle modification after delivery, and metformin treatment remains controversial as a T2DM preventive strategy. We hypothesized modulation of the composition of gut microbiota with probiotics supplementation may reverse postpartum glucose intolerance in post-GDM women. In this review, we addressed gut microbiota dysbiosis and the possible mechanistic links between the host and gut microbiota in women with GDM. Furthermore, this review highlights the potential therapeutic use of probiotics in post-GDM women as a T2DM preventive strategy.",

The dhole (<i>Cuon alpinus</i>) has been listed as endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; therefore, conservation and effective breeding of dholes are essential. Effective estrus can promote reproduction. However, little is known about the relative contribution of estrus in shaping the structure and the functions of fecal microbiota. Here, we investigated the potential association between estrus and the fecal microbiota in dholes using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that the estrus stages in dholes vary significantly in terms of gut bacterial composition and microbiome metabolism and function. Compared with that of non-estrus, adult dholes, the microbiome of estrus adult dholes had a significantly higher abundance of <i>Bacillus faecalis</i> and <i>Veillonella</i>, which play a key role in the synthesis of sex hormones and nucleic acids, energy production, and reproductive cell division. The insulin and energy metabolism-related pathways are significantly enhanced in the gut microbes and the related gluconeogenic enzymes are significantly enriched during estrus. These findings suggest that the structure and metagenome of the fecal microbiome during estrus have a significant effect in promoting estrus in dholes, thus providing a new perspective for dhole conservation.",

The first filial generation (F1) hybrids of Hainan black goats and Saanen goats had different traits, black goats (BG) and white goats (WG), which also brought different production performance. We explored the difference of gut microbiota between black goats and white goats that both belonged to the first filial generation (F1) hybrids. In general, the alpha diversity of the black goat group was significantly higher than the white goat group. The species richness had no significant difference, while the species evenness of BG was higher than WG. Bacteroides, Oscillospira, Alistipes, Ruminococcus, Clostridium and Oscillibacter, as the core gut microbial genera, all had high abundance in BG and WG group. Only the Bacteroides and Bacteroidaceae 5-7N15 were the different genera between the BG and WG group, of which Bacteroides overlapped with the core genera and enriched in the WG group. Besides, PICRUSt analysis showed that there was a high abundance in the secondary metabolic pathways including membrane transport, replication and repair, carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism. We found the intestinal microbial species of black goats and white goats were very similar for living in the identical growing environment and feeding conditions, but there was still a slight difference in the content. On the one hand, it was proved that the small effect of genotype and the great effect of diet affected the intestinal microbiota together. On the other hand, it was also proved that these different traits of first filial generation (F1) hybrids may not related to gut microbiota and only because of different genotype. Moreover, characterization of the gut microbiota in BG and WG will be useful in goats gut microbiota research.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the gut microbiome and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) affect finishing weight is beneficial to improve meat production in the meat rabbit industry. In this study, we identified 15 OTUs and 23 microbial species associated with finishing weight using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing analysis, respectively. Among these, butyrate-producing bacteria of the family Ruminococcaceae were positively associated with finishing weight, whereas the microbial taxa related to intestinal damage and inflammation showed opposite effects. Furthermore, interactions of these microbial taxa were firstly found to be associated with finishing weight. Gut microbial functional capacity analysis revealed that CAZymes, such as galactosidase, xylanase, and glucosidase, could significantly affect finishing weight, given their roles in regulating nutrient digestibility. GOs related to the metabolism of several carbohydrates and amino acids also showed important effects on finishing weight. Additionally, both KOs and KEGG pathways related to the membrane transportation system and involved in aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and butanoate metabolism could act as key factors in modulating finishing weight. Importantly, gut microbiome explained nearly 11% of the variation in finishing weight, and our findings revealed that a subset of metagenomic species could act as predictors of finishing weight. SCFAs levels, especially butyrate level, had critical impacts on finishing weight, and several finishing weight-associated species were potentially contributed to the shift in butyrate level. Thus, our results should give deep insights into how gut microbiome and SCFAs influence finishing weight of meat rabbits and provide essential knowledge for improving finishing weight by manipulating gut microbiome.",

However, infants delivered by Cesarean section (CS) do not contact the maternal vaginal microbiome and this delivery method may perturb the early establishment and development of the gut microbiome. The aim of this study was to investigate the early gut microbiota of Korean newborns receiving the same postpartum care services for two weeks after birth by delivery mode using fecal samples collected at days 3, 7, and 14. Early gut microbiota development patterns were examined using 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing from 132 infants either born vaginally (VD, <i>n</i> = 64) or via Cesarean section (CS, <i>n</i> = 68). VD-born neonates showed increased alpha diversity in infant fecal samples collated at days 7 and 14 compared to those from day 3, while those of CS infants did not differ (<i>p</i> < 0.015). Bacterial structures of infants from both groups separated at day 7 (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and day 14 (<i>p</i> < 0.01). The bacterial structure of VD infants gradually changed over time (day 3 vs. day 7, <i>p</i> < 0.012; day 3 vs. day 14, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Day 14 samples of CS infants differed from day 3 and 7 samples (day 3 vs. day 14, <i>p</i> < 0.001). VD infant relative abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> (days 7, 14), <i>Bacteroides</i> (days 7, 14), and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> (day 7) significantly increased compared to CS infants, with a lower abundance of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> (found in all periods of the CS group) (LDA > 3.0). Relative abundances of <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus</i> were significantly increased in both VD and CS groups at day 14 (LDA > 3.0). Predicted functional analysis showed that VD infants had overrepresented starch/sucrose, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism in gut microbiota with depleted lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis until day 14 compared to CS infants. This study confirmed that delivery mode is the major determinant of neonatal intestinal microbiome establishment and provides a profile of microbiota perturbations in CS infants. Our findings provide preliminary insight for establishing recovery methods to supply the specific microbes missing in CS infants.",

While high throughput metagenomic sequencing reveals genotypes of microbial communities, the functionality, phenotype and heterogeneity of human gut microbiota are still elusive. In this study, we applied Raman microscopy and deuterium isotope probing (Raman-DIP) to detect metabolic active ARB (MA-ARB) in situ at the single-cell level in human gut microbiota from two healthy adults. We analysed the relative abundances of MA-ARB under different concentrations of amoxicillin, cephalexin, tetracycline, florfenicol and vancomycin. To establish the link between phenotypes and genotypes of the MA-ARB, Raman-activated cell sorting (RACS) was used to sort MA-ARB from human gut microbiota, and mini-metagenomic DNA of the sorted bacteria was amplified, sequenced and analysed. The sorted MA-ARB and their associated ARGs were identified. Our results suggest a strong relation between ARB in human gut microbiota and personal medical history. This study demonstrates that the toolkit of Raman-DIP, RACS and DNA sequencing can be useful to unravel both phenotypes and genotypes of ARB in human gut microbiota at the single-cell level.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Tor putitora, the largest freshwater fish of the Indian subcontinent, is an endangered species. Several factors have been attributed towards its continuous population decrease, but very little is known about the gut microbiome of this fish. Also, the fish gut microbiome serves as a reservoir of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance determinants. Therefore, the shotgun metagenomic approach was employed to investigate the taxonomic composition and functional potential of microbial communities present in the gut of Tor putitora, as well as the detection of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes in the microbiome.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis of bacterial diversity showed that Proteobacteria was predominant phylum, followed by Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. Within Proteobacteria, Aeromonas and Caulobacter were chiefly present; also, Klebsiella, Escherichia, and plant symbionts were noticeably detected. Functional characterization of gut microbes endowed the virulence determinants, while surveillance of antibiotic resistance genes showed the dominance of β-lactamase variants. The antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli pathovars were also detected. Microbial genome reconstruction and comparative genomics confirmed the presence of Aeromonads, the predominant fish pathogens.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Gut microbiome of endangered Tor putitora consisted of both commensals and opportunistic pathogens, implying that factors adversely affecting the non-pathogenic population would allow colonization and proliferation of pathogens causing diseased state in asymptomatic Tor putitora. The presence of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes suggested the potential risk of dissemination to other bacteria due to horizontal gene transfer, thereby posing a threat to fish and human health. The preservation of healthy gut microflora and limited use of antibiotics are some of the prerequisites for the conservation of this imperilled species.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Gut microbiome alterations are closely related to human health and linked to a variety of diseases. Although great efforts have been made to understand the risk factors for multiple myeloma (MM), little is known about the role of the gut microbiome and alterations of its metabolic functions in the development of MM.<h4>Results</h4>Here, in a cohort of newly diagnosed patients with MM and healthy controls (HCs), significant differences in metagenomic composition were discovered, for the first time, with higher bacterial diversity in MM. Specifically, nitrogen-recycling bacteria such as Klebsiella and Streptococcus were significantly enriched in MM. Also, the bacteria enriched in MM were significantly correlated with the host metabolome, suggesting strong metabolic interactions between microbes and the host. In addition, the MM-enriched bacteria likely result from the regulation of urea nitrogen accumulated during MM progression. Furthermore, by performing fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) into 5TGM1 mice, we proposed a mechanistic explanation for the interaction between MM-enriched bacteria and MM progression via recycling urea nitrogen. Further experiments validated that Klebsiella pneumoniae promoted MM progression via de novo synthesis of glutamine in mice and that the mice fed with glutamine-deficient diet exhibited slower MM progression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, our findings unveil a novel function of the altered gut microbiome in accelerating the malignant progression of MM and open new avenues for novel treatment strategies via manipulation of the intestinal microbiota of MM patients.

Although limited, emerging data suggest that gut microbiota dysfunction may be a new mechanism underlying CD pathogenesis. <i>T. cruzi</i> infection leads to changes in the gut microbiota composition of vector insects, mice, and humans. Alterations in insect and mice microbiota due to <i>T. cruzi</i> have been associated with a decreased immune response against the parasite, influencing the establishment and progression of infection. Further, changes in the gut microbiota are linked with inflammatory and neuropsychiatric disorders, comorbid conditions in CD. Therefore, this review article critically analyses the current data on CD and the gut microbiota of insects, mice, and humans and discusses its importance for CD pathogenesis. An enhanced understanding of host microbiota will be critical for the development of alternative therapeutic approaches to target CD, such as gut microbiota-directed interventions.",

We established a diarrhea model induced by gentamycin and cefradine to investigate the microbiota characteristics in the intestinal lumen of mice with AAD and provide insights into noteworthy bacteria related to gentamicin and cefradine-associated diarrhea.<h4>Results</h4>The number of OTUs in the model group and the normal group was 983 and 2107, respectively, and 872 identical OTUs were shared between two groups. Species richness and species diversity of intestinal microbe were altered by antibiotics administration. PCoA showed a clear separation between AAD and health control. The dominant phyla of AAD mice were Firmicutes (52.63%) and Proteobacteria (46.37%). Among the genus with top 20 abundance, the relative abundance of 7 genera, Ruminococcus, Blautia, Enterococcus, Eubacterium, Clostridium, Coprococcus, and Aerococcus, were enriched in the model group. Based upon the LEfSe analysis, Enterococcus, Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, and Blautia were identified as potential biomarkers for AAD.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The bacterial diversity of the intestinal lumen was diminished after gentamicin and cefradine administration. The alterations in the abundance and composition of gut microbiota further led to the dysfunction of gut microbiota. More specifically, gentamicin and cefradine significantly increased the abundance of the opportunistic pathogens, of which Enterococcus and Clostridium were the most prominent and most worthy of attention.",

Though it is one of the widely used food additives, strategies of the human gut microbes to evade its antimicrobial activity await extensive elucidation. The current study explores the human gut microbiome with a multi-omics approach to elucidate its composition and metabolic machinery to counter vanillin bioactivity. A combination of SSU rRNA gene diversity, metagenomic RNA features diversity, phylogenetic affiliation of metagenome encoded proteins, uniformly (<i>R</i> = 0.99) indicates the abundance of Bacteroidetes followed by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Manual curation of metagenomic dataset identified gene clusters specific for the vanillin metabolism (<i>ligV, ligK</i>, and <i>vanK</i>) and intermediary metabolic pathways (<i>pca</i> and <i>cat</i> operon). Metagenomic dataset comparison identified the omnipresence of vanillin catabolic features across diverse populations. The metabolomic analysis brings forth the functionality of the vanillin catabolic pathway through the Protocatechuate branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway. These results highlight the human gut microbial features and metabolic bioprocess involved in vanillin catabolism to overcome its antimicrobial activity.

    "abstract": "Tench (Tinca tinca L.) is one of the most valued species of the Cyprinidae. This species is commercially important and has been intensively domesticated in recent years. To avoid excessive production losses, the health of farm fish must be maintained. Characterization of the tench gut microbiome can help achieve this goal, as the gastrointestinal microbiome plays an important role in host health. As part of this characterization, investigating the influence of the environment and season will help to understand the interrelationship between host and gut microbiota. Therefore, our aim was to use high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to profile the gut microbiome of tench. We studied two populations in summer and autumn: wild tench living in a lake and tench living in a pond in a semi-intensive fish farm. We found that, in the gut microbiome of all fish, the most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Together, these phyla constituted up to 90% of the microbial communities. The abundance of Candidatus Xiphinematobacter differed significantly between lake and pond fish in summer, but not in autumn. In pond tench, Methylobacterium abundance was significantly lower in summer than in autumn. Mean Shannon, Chao1 indices and observed OTU's indicated that microbial biodiversity was greater in the gut of lake fish than in that of pond fish. Beta-diversity analysis showed significant divergence between groups with both weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance matrices. Principal coordinates analysis revealed that more of the variance in microbial diversity was attributable to environment than to season. Although some of the diversity in lake tench gut microbiota could be attributable to feeding preferences of individual fish, our results suggest that environment is the main factor in determining gut microbiome diversity in tench.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities infiltrate the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients, where chronic colonization and infection lead to clinical decline. This report aims to provide an overview of the diversity of bacterial and fungal species from the airway secretion of three young CF patients with severe pulmonary disease. The bacterial and fungal microbiomes were investigated by culture isolation, metataxonomics, and metagenomics shotgun. Virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes were also explored. <i>A. fumigatus</i> was isolated from cultures and identified in high incidence from patient sputum samples. <i>Candida albicans, Penicillium</i> sp., <i>Hanseniaspora</i> sp., <i>Torulaspora delbrueckii</i>, and <i>Talaromyces amestolkiae</i> were isolated sporadically. Metataxonomics and metagenomics detected fungal reads (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>A. fumigatus</i>, and <i>Schizophyllum</i> sp.) in one sputum sample. The main pathogenic bacteria identified were <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> complex, and <i>Achromobacter xylosoxidans</i>. The canonical core CF microbiome is composed of species from the genera <i>Streptococcus, Neisseria, Rothia, Prevotella</i>, and <i>Haemophilus</i>. Thus, the airways of the three young CF patients presented dominant bacterial genera and interindividual variability in microbial community composition and diversity. Additionally, a wide diversity of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes were identified in the CF lung microbiomes, which may be linked to the clinical condition of the CF patients. Understanding the microbial community is crucial to improve therapy because it may have the opposite effect, restructuring the pathogenic microbiota. Future studies focusing on the influence of fungi on bacterial diversity and microbial interactions in CF microbiomes will be welcome to fulfill this huge gap of fungal influence on CF physiopathology.",

    "abstract": "The current study investigated the effects of inulin on the gut microbiota, microbiome functions, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens infected with <i>Salmonella</i> enteritidis (SE). SPF Arbor Acres chickens (<i>n</i> = 240, 1-day-old) were divided into four groups: a control group (CON) fed a basal diet without inulin supplementation or SE infection, and three groups fed a basal diet supplemented with inulin 0, 0.5, and 1% (SE, 0.5%InSE, 1%InSE, respectively) up to 28-days-old, followed by SE challenge at 28 days of age. Cecal SCFA contents and microbiome composition and function were analyzed at 1-day post-infection. The results showed that SE infection significantly decreased cecal butyrate concentrations compared with the CON group (<i>p</i> < 0.05), while inulin supplementation reversed these changes compared with the SE group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Inulin supplementation at 1% significantly increased the abundances of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i>, and significantly decreased the abundances of <i>Subdoligranulum</i> and <i>Sellimonas</i> compared with the SE group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The functional profiles of microbial communities based on metagenomic sequencing analysis showed that SE infection significantly increased the abundances of pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and significantly decreased the abundances of pathways related to nucleotide metabolism, translation, and replication and repair compared with the CON group (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and these effects were reversed by inulin supplementation (0.5 and 1%) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In conclusion, inulin modulated the dysbiosis induced by SE infection via affecting SCFA metabolism and microbial functional profiles.",

    "abstract": "With improved standards of living, the incidence of multiple metabolic disorders has increased year by year, especially major risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, continues to increase. Emerging epidemiological data and clinical trials have shown the additional protective effects of some metabolic therapy drugs against cardiovascular diseases. A series of studies have found that these drugs may work by modulating the composition of gut microbiota. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the contribution of the gut microbiota to both metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases, as well as the response of gut microbiota to metabolic therapy drugs with cardiovascular benefits. In this manner, we link the recent advances in microbiome studies on metabolic treatment drugs with their cardiovascular protective effects, suggesting that intestinal microorganisms may play a potential role in reducing cardiovascular risk factors. We also discuss the potential of microorganism-targeted therapeutics as treatment strategies for preventing and/or treating cardiovascular disease and highlight the need to establish causal links between therapeutics for metabolic diseases, gut microbiota modulation, and cardiovascular protection.",

    "title": "Investigating host-microbiome interactions by droplet based microfluidics.",
    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Despite the importance of the mucosal interface between microbiota and the host in gut homeostasis, little is known about the mechanisms of bacterial gut colonization, involving foraging for glycans produced by epithelial cells. The slow pace of progress toward understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms is largely due to the lack of efficient discovery tools, especially those targeting the uncultured fraction of the microbiota.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce an ultra-high-throughput metagenomic approach based on droplet microfluidics, to screen fosmid libraries. Thousands of bacterial genomes can be covered in 1 h of work, with less than ten micrograms of substrate. Applied to the screening of the mucosal microbiota for β-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity, this approach allowed the identification of pathways involved in the degradation of human gangliosides and milk oligosaccharides, the structural homologs of intestinal mucin glycans. These pathways, whose prevalence is associated with inflammatory bowel diseases, could be the result of horizontal gene transfers with Bacteroides species. Such pathways represent novel targets to study the microbiota-host interactions in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases, in which the integrity of the mucosal barrier is impaired.<h4>Conclusion</h4>By compartmentalizing experiments inside microfluidic droplets, this method speeds up and miniaturizes by several orders of magnitude the screening process compared to conventional approaches, to capture entire metabolic pathways from metagenomic libraries. The method is compatible with all types of (meta)genomic libraries, and employs a commercially available flow cytometer instead of a custom-made sorting system to detect intracellular or extracellular enzyme activities. This versatile and generic workflow will accelerate experimental exploration campaigns in functional metagenomics and holobiomics studies, to further decipher host-microbiota relationships.

    "abstract": "The relationship between microbial community and host has profound effects on the health of animals. A balanced gastrointestinal (GI) microbial population provides nutritional and metabolic benefits to its host, regulates the immune system and various signaling molecules, protects the intestine from pathogen invasion, and promotes a healthy intestinal structure and an optimal intestinal function. With the fast development of next-generation sequencing, molecular techniques have become standard tools for microbiota research, having been used to demonstrate the complex intestinal ecosystem. Similarly to other mammals, the vast majority of GI microbiota in cats (over 99%) is composed of the predominant bacterial phyla <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, and <i>Proteobacteria</i>. Many nutritional and clinical studies have shown that cats' microbiota can be affected by several different factors including body condition, age, diet, and inflammatory diseases. All these factors have different size effects, and some of these may be very minor, and it is currently unknown how important these are. Further research is needed to determine the functional variations in the microbiome in disease states and in response to environmental and/or dietary modulations. Additionally, further studies are also needed to explain the intricate relationship between GI microbiota and the genetics and immunity of its host. This review summarizes past and present knowledge of the feline GI microbiota and looks into the future possibilities and challenges of the field.",

    "title": "Metagenomic analysis reveals the microbiome and resistome in migratory birds.",
    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Antibiotic-resistant pathogens pose high risks to human and animal health worldwide. In recent years, the role of gut microbiota as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in humans and animals has been increasingly investigated. However, the structure and function of the gut bacterial community, as well as the ARGs they carry in migratory birds remain unknown.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we collected samples from migratory bird species and their associated environments and characterized their gut microbiomes and resistomes using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that migratory birds vary greatly in gut bacterial composition but are similar in their microbiome metabolism and function. Birds from the same environment tend to harbor similar bacterial communities. In total, 1030 different ARGs (202 resistance types) conferring resistance to tetracycline, aminoglycoside, β-lactam, sulphonamide, chloramphenicol, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS), and quinolone are identified. Procrustes analysis indicated that microbial community structure is not correlated with the resistome in migratory birds. Moreover, metagenomic assembly-based host tracking revealed that most of the ARG-carrying contigs originate from Proteobacteria. Co-occurrence patterns revealed by network analysis showed that emrD, emrY, ANT(6)-Ia, and tetO, the hubs of ARG type network, are indicators of other co-occurring ARG types. Compared with the microbiomes and resistomes in the environment, migratory birds harbor a lower phylogenetic diversity but have more antibiotic resistance proteins. Interestingly, we found that the mcr-1 resistance gene is widespread among different birds, accounting for 50% of the total samples. Meanwhile, a large number of novel β-lactamase genes are also reconstructed from bird metagenomic assemblies based on fARGene software.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the diversity and abundance of ARGs in migratory birds and highlights the possible role of migratory birds as ARG disseminators into the environment.

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that gut microbiota can affect human immune system in many ways. Our aim was to investigate quantitative differences in fecal bacterial compositions of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients compared to those of healthy children, so as to identify individual bacterial species that are related to the etiology of ALL. We recruited 81 subjects, including 58 patients with ALL and 23 healthy controls. Fecal samples were collected and examined by 16S rRNA quantitative arrays and bioinformatics analysis. Both Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) and Non-metric Multidimensional scaling (NMDS) demonstrated that the microbial composition of ALL patients deviated from the tight cluster of healthy controls. Multiple bacterial species exhibited significant changes (e.g., <i>Roseburia faecis, Edwardsiella tarda</i>, and <i>Fusobacterium naviforme</i>) in the ALL samples. Some of the differentially abundant taxa were correlated with the level of interleukin-10. The ALL cases could be efficiently distinguished from healthy controls by the random forest model based on differential species (area under ROC curve = 0.843). Taken together, the composition of gut microbiota differed from healthy controls to pediatric ALL patients. Our study identified a series of ALL-related species in the gut microbiota, providing a new direction for future studies aiming to understand the host-gut microbiota interplay in ALL pathogenesis.",

Forty-three participants consumed an MD tailored to their habitual energy intakes (MedD), and 39 maintained their regular diets (ConD). Dietary adherence, metabolic parameters, gut microbiome and systemic metabolome were monitored over the study period.<h4>Results</h4>Increased MD adherence in the MedD group successfully reprogrammed subjects' intake of fibre and animal proteins. Compliance was confirmed by lowered levels of carnitine in plasma and urine. Significant reductions in plasma cholesterol (primary outcome) and faecal bile acids occurred in the MedD compared with the ConD group. Shotgun metagenomics showed gut microbiome changes that reflected individual MD adherence and increase in gene richness in participants who reduced systemic inflammation over the intervention. The MD intervention led to increased levels of the fibre-degrading <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> and of genes for microbial carbohydrate degradation linked to butyrate metabolism. The dietary changes in the MedD group led to increased urinary urolithins, faecal bile acid degradation and insulin sensitivity that co-varied with specific microbial taxa.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Switching subjects to an MD while maintaining their energy intake reduced their blood cholesterol and caused multiple changes in their microbiome and metabolome that are relevant in future strategies for the improvement of metabolic health.",

By analyzing 16S rRNA and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing data in tandem with culture-based methods, we show that farm exposure shapes the gut microbiome of students, resulting in enrichment of potentially pathogenic taxa and antimicrobial resistance genes. Comparison of students' gut microbiomes and resistomes to farm workers' and environmental samples revealed extensive sharing of resistance genes and bacteria following exposure and after three months of their visit. Notably, antibiotic resistance genes were found in similar genetic contexts in student samples and farm environmental samples. Dynamic Bayesian network modeling predicted that the observed changes partially reverse over a 4-6 month period.

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The mammalian intestinal tract harbors diverse and dynamic microbial communities that play pivotal roles in host health, metabolism, immunity, and development. Average daily gain (ADG) is an important growth trait in meat rabbit industry. The effects of gut microbiota on ADG in meat rabbits are still unknown.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we investigated the dynamic distribution of gut microbiota in commercial Ira rabbits from weaning to finishing and uncover the relationship between the microbiota and average daily gain (ADG) via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results indicated that the richness and diversity of gut microbiota significantly increased with age. Gut microbial structure was less variable among finishing rabbits than among weaning rabbits. The relative abundances of the dominant phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia and Cyanobacteria, and the 15 predominant genera significantly varied with age. Metagenomic prediction analysis showed that both KOs and KEGG pathways related to the metabolism of monosaccharides and vitamins were enriched in the weaning rabbits, while those related to the metabolism of amino acids and polysaccharides were more abundant in the finishing rabbits. We identified 34 OTUs, 125 KOs, and 25 KEGG pathways that were significantly associated with ADG. OTUs annotation suggested that butyrate producing bacteria belong to the family Ruminococcaceae and Bacteroidales_S24-7_group were positively associated with ADG. Conversely, Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, and opportunistic pathogens were negatively associated with ADG. Both KOs and KEGG pathways correlated with the metabolism of vitamins, basic amino acids, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) showed positive correlations with ADG, while those correlated with aromatic amino acids metabolism and immune response exhibited negative correlations with ADG. In addition, our results suggested that 10.42% of the variation in weaning weight could be explained by the gut microbiome.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings give a glimpse into the dynamic shifts in gut microbiota of meat rabbits and provide a theoretical basis for gut microbiota modulation to improve ADG in the meat rabbit industry.",

    "abstract": "Responses to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) and therapy-related toxicities in rectal cancer vary among patients. To provide the individualized therapeutic option for each patient, predictive markers of therapeutic responses and toxicities are in critical need. We aimed to identify the association of gut microbiome with and its potential predictive value for therapeutic responses and toxicities. In the present study, we collected fecal microbiome samples from patients with rectal cancer at treatment initiation and just after nCRT. Taxonomic profiling <i>via</i> 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed on all samples. Patients were classified as responders versus non-responders. Patients were grouped into no or mild diarrhea and severe diarrhea. STAMP and high-dimensional class comparisons <i>via</i> linear discriminant analysis of effect size (LEfSe) were used to compare the compositional differences between groups. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) was utilized to predict differences in metabolic function between groups. Ten patients were classified as responders and 12 patients were classified as non-responders. Fourteen patients experienced no or mild diarrhea and 8 patients experienced severe diarrhea. Several bacteria taxa with significantly different relative abundances before and after nCRT were identified. Similarly, several baseline bacteria taxa and predicted pathways with significantly different relative abundances between responders and non-responders or between patients no or mild diarrhea and severe diarrhea were identified. Specifically, <i>Shuttleworthia</i> was identified as enriched in responders and several bacteria taxa in the <i>Clostridiales</i> order etc. were identified as enriched in non-responders. Pathways including fatty acid metabolism were predicted to be enriched in responders. In addition, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Clostridia</i>, and <i>Bacteroides</i> etc. were identified as enriched in patients with no or mild diarrhea. Pathways including primary bile acid biosynthesis were predicted to be enriched in patients with no or mild diarrhea. Together, the microbiota and pathway markers identified in this study may be utilized to predict the therapeutic responses and therapy-related toxicities of nCRT in patients with rectal cancer. More patient data is needed to verify the current findings and the results of metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic analyses will further mine key biomarkers at the compositional and functional level.",

    "title": "Differential Responses to Dietary Protein and Carbohydrate Ratio on Gut Microbiome in Obese vs. Lean Cats.",
    "abstract": "More than 60% of domestic cats in the United States are either overweight or obese (OW). High-protein low-carbohydrate (HPLC) diets have been recommended for weight management for humans and pets. Gut microbes can influence the host's health and metabolism. Less is known about feline gut microbiomes compared to other species. Thirty-nine lean (LN) and OW domestic short-haired cats (median age, 7.2 years) with median body fat of 15.8 and 32.5%, respectively, were enrolled in a two-phase study. All cats were fed the control diet (CON) with 32.4% protein and 32.3% carbohydrate for 8 weeks followed by another 8 weeks of intervention where half of the cats continued the CON diet while the other half were switched to a HPLC diet with 51.4% protein and 11.6% carbohydrate. The goal was to understand how the HPLC diet influenced gut microbiota in obese vs. lean cats. The 16S rRNA gene profiling study revealed a significant impact on gut microbiome by dietary protein and carbohydrate ratio. The effect was more pronounced in OW cats than LN cats. While no microbial taxon was different between groups in LN cats, compositional changes occurred at different taxonomical ranks in OW cats. At the phylum level, <i>Fusobacteria</i> became more abundant in HPLC-fed cats than in CON-fed cats. At the genus level, five short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers had altered compositions in response to the diets: <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Fusobacterium</i> are more abundant in HPLC-fed cats while the abundances of <i>Megasphaera</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, and <i>Veillonella</i> increased in CON-fed cats. Predicted microbial gene networks showed changes in energy metabolism and one-carbon metabolism pathways. Our study demonstrated differential responses to HPLC diet between obese vs. lean cats and opportunities to explore these SCFA-producers for weight management in cats.",

    "title": "Distinct actions of the fermented beverage kefir on host behaviour, immunity and microbiome gut-brain modules in the mouse.",
    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Mounting evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiota in modulating brain physiology and behaviour, through bi-directional communication, along the gut-brain axis. As such, the gut microbiota represents a potential therapeutic target for influencing centrally mediated events and host behaviour. It is thus notable that the fermented milk beverage kefir has recently been shown to modulate the composition of the gut microbiota in mice. It is unclear whether kefirs have differential effects on microbiota-gut-brain axis and whether they can modulate host behaviour per se.<h4>Methods</h4>To address this, two distinct kefirs (Fr1 and UK4), or unfermented milk control, were administered to mice that underwent a battery of tests to characterise their behavioural phenotype. In addition, shotgun metagenomic sequencing of ileal, caecal and faecal matter was performed, as was faecal metabolome analysis. Finally, systemic immunity measures and gut serotonin levels were assessed. Statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post hoc test or Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney U test.<h4>Results</h4>Fr1 ameliorated the stress-induced decrease in serotonergic signalling in the colon and reward-seeking behaviour in the saccharin preference test. On the other hand, UK4 decreased repetitive behaviour and ameliorated stress-induced deficits in reward-seeking behaviour. Furthermore, UK4 increased fear-dependent contextual memory, yet decreased milk gavage-induced improvements in long-term spatial learning. In the peripheral immune system, UK4 increased the prevalence of Treg cells and interleukin 10 levels, whereas Fr1 ameliorated the milk gavage stress-induced elevation in neutrophil levels and CXCL1 levels. Analysis of the gut microbiota revealed that both kefirs significantly changed the composition and functional capacity of the host microbiota, where specific bacterial species were changed in a kefir-dependent manner. Furthermore, both kefirs increased the capacity of the gut microbiota to produce GABA, which was linked to an increased prevalence in Lactobacillus reuteri.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Altogether, these data show that kefir can signal through the microbiota-gut-immune-brain axis and modulate host behaviour. In addition, different kefirs may direct the microbiota toward distinct immunological and behavioural modulatory effects. These results indicate that kefir can positively modulate specific aspects of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and support the broadening of the definition of psychobiotic to include kefir fermented foods.

    "abstract": "Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes cardiopulmonary and vascular complications, ranging in severity. Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of the novel SARS-CoV2 infection and progression can provide potential novel targets for its prevention and/or treatment. Virus microbiota reciprocal interactions have been studied in a variety of viral infections. For example, the integrity of Coronavirus particles can be disrupted by surfactin, a bacterial surface molecule that targets other viruses, including that of influenza A. In this light, intestinal microbiota likely influences COVID-19 virulence, while from its side SARS-CoV-2 may affect the intestinal microbiome promoting dysbiosis and other deleterious consequences. Hence, the microbiota pre-existing health status and its alterations in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, are likely to play an important, still underscored role in determining individual susceptibility and resilience to COVID-19. Indeed, the vast majority of COVID-19 worst clinical conditions and fatalities develop in subjects with specific risk factors such as aging and the presence of one or more comorbidities, which are intriguingly characterized also by unhealthy microbiome status. Moreover, these comorbidities require complex pharmacological regimens known as \"polypharmacy\" that may further affect microbiota integrity and worsen the resilience to viral infections. This complex situation may represent a further and underestimated risk with regard to COVID-19 clinical burden for the elderly and comorbid people. Here, we discuss the possible biological, physiopathological, and clinical implications of gut microbiota in COVID-19 and the strategies to improve/maintain its healthy status as a simple and adjunctive strategy to reduce COVID-19 virulence and socio-sanitary burden.",

Altered fecal microbiota (FM) ecology was reported in newborns affected by intestinal ischemia. Our purpose was to describe, in these patients, the FM, the mucosal microbiota (MM) and the mucosal immunity. <b>Methods:</b> Fourteen newborns underwent intestinal resection because of intestinal ischemia. FM and MM were determined through targeted-metagenomics, diversity assignment and Kruskal-Wallis analyses of Operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The mucosal immune cells were analyzed through cytofluorimetry. <b>Results and Conclusion:</b> Based on the severity intestinal injueris we identified two groups: extensive (EII) and focal intestinal ischemia (FII). FM and MM varied in EII and FII groups, showing in the EII group the predominance of Proteobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae and the reduction of Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia for both microbiota. The MM was characterized by a statistically significant reduction of <i>Bacteroides</i>, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae and by a higher diversity in the EII compared to FII group. FM showed a prevalence of Proteobacteria, while the Shannon index was lower in the EII compared to FII group. An overall increment in B- and T-lymphocytes and Natural killer (NK) T-like cells was found for EII mucosal samples associated to an increment of TNF-α and INF-γ expressing cells, compared to FII group. FM and MM carry specific signatures of intestinal ischemic lesions. Further research may be crucial to address the role of specific taxa in EII, expecially with reference to inflammation grade and ischemia extension.",

Given that determining virus composition and function in association with states of human health and disease is of increasing interest, we anticipate that the field of viral metagenomics will continue to expand and be applied in a variety of areas ranging from surveillance to discovery and will rely heavily upon the continued development of reference materials and databases. Information regarding viral composition and function readily translates into biological and clinical applications, including the rapid sequence identification of pathogenic viruses in various sample types. However, viral metagenomic approaches often lack appropriate standards and reference materials to enable cross-study comparisons and assess potential biases which can be introduced at the various stages of collection, storage, processing, and sequence analysis. In addition, implementation of appropriate viral reference materials can aid in the benchmarking of current and development of novel assays for virus identification, discovery, and surveillance.

However, the results of different studies on gut microbiota are highly variable even in the same disease, which makes it difficult to guide clinical diagnosis and treatment. The ideal sampling method should be non-invasive, involve little cross-contamination or bowel preparation, and collect gut microbiota at different sites. Currently, sequencing technologies are usually based on samples collected from feces, mucosal biopsy, intestinal fluid, etc. However, different parts of the gastrointestinal tract possess various physiological characteristics that are essential for particular species of living microbiota. Moreover, current sampling methods are somewhat defective. For example, fecal samples are just a proxy for intestinal microbiota, while biopsies are invasive for patients and not suitable for healthy controls. In this review, we summarize the current sampling methods and their advantages and shortcomings. New sampling technologies, such as the Brisbane Aseptic Biopsy Device and the intelligent capsule, are also mentioned to inspire the development of future precise description methods of the gut microbiome.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Microbial communities of the mouse gut have been extensively studied; however, their functional roles and regulation are yet to be elucidated. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses may allow us a comprehensive profiling of bacterial composition and functions of the complex gut microbiota. The present study aimed to investigate the active functions of the microbial communities in the murine cecum by analyzing both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data on specific bacterial species within the microbial communities, in addition to the whole microbiome.<h4>Results</h4>Bacterial composition of the healthy mouse gut microbiome was profiled using the following three different approaches: 16S rRNA-based profiling based on amplicon and shotgun sequencing data, and genome-based profiling based on shotgun sequencing data. Consistently, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Deferribacteres emerged as the major phyla. Based on NCBI taxonomy, Muribaculaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Deferribacteraceae were the predominant families identified in each phylum. The genes for carbohydrate metabolism were upregulated in Muribaculaceae, while genes for cofactors and vitamin metabolism and amino acid metabolism were upregulated in Deferribacteraceae. The genes for translation were commonly enhanced in all three families. Notably, combined analysis of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing data revealed that the functions of translation and metabolism were largely upregulated in all three families in the mouse gut environment. The ratio of the genes in the metagenome and their expression in the metatranscriptome indicated higher expression of carbohydrate metabolism in Muribaculum, Duncaniella, and Mucispirillum.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrated a fundamental methodology for linking genomic and transcriptomic datasets to examine functional activities of specific bacterial species in a complicated microbial environment. We investigated the normal flora of the mouse gut using three different approaches and identified Muribaculaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Deferribacteraceae as the predominant families. The functional distribution of these families was reflected in the entire microbiome. By comparing the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data, we found that the expression rates differed for different functional categories in the mouse gut environment. Application of these methods to track microbial transcription in individuals over time, or before and after administration of a specific stimulus will significantly facilitate future development of diagnostics and treatments.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have identified oral administration of antibiotics and gut-impacting drugs as critical drivers for fecal antibiotic resistance (AR) and microbiome disruption in lab mice, but the practical implications of these findings have yet to be validated in hosts nurtured in conventional environment. Using ampicillin (Amp) as a way to extrapolate the general effect of antibiotics, this project examined the impact of drug administration routes on fecal microbiota and resistome using poultry raised in a teaching farm. AR genes were found to be abundant in the feces of young Leghorn chicks without previous antibiotic treatment. In chickens seeded with <i>bla</i> <sub>CMY-2</sub> <sup>+</sup> <i>Escherichia coli</i>, 300 mg/kg body weight of Amp was orally administered for 5 days. This led to the fecal microbiota switching from Firmicutes occupied (95.60 ± 2.62%) and <i>Lactobacillus</i> rich, to being dominated by Proteobacteria (70.91 ± 28.93%), especially <i>Escherichia/Shigella</i>. However, when Amp was given via muscle injection, Firmicutes was mostly retained (i.e., from 83.6 ± 24.4% pre- to 90.4 ± 15.2% post-treatment). In control chickens without seeding with <i>bla</i> <sub>CMY-2</sub> <sup>+</sup> <i>E. coli</i>, oral Amp also led to the increase of Proteobacteria, dominated by <i>Klebsiella</i> and <i>Escherichia</i>/<i>Shigella</i>, and a reduction of Firmicutes. Specifically within Firmicutes, <i>Enterococcus, Clostridium</i>, etc. were enriched but <i>Lactobacillus</i> was diminished. The fecal resistome including Amp<sup>r</sup> genes was more abundant in chickens receiving oral Amp than those treated with muscle injection, but the difference was primarily within 1 log. The data illustrated that both drug administration routes and pre-existing gut microbiota have profound impacts on gut microbiome disruption when antibiotic treatment is given. In hosts nurtured in a conventional environment, drug administration route has the most evident impact on gut microbiota rather than the size of the targeted <i>bla</i> <sub>CMY-2</sub> <sup>+</sup> gene pool, likely due to the pre-existing bacteria that are (i) less susceptible to Amp, and/or (ii) with Amp<sup>r</sup>- or multidrug resistance-encoding genes other than <i>bla</i> <sub>CMY-2</sub> <sup>+</sup>. These results demonstrated the critical interplay among drug administration routes, microbiota seeded through the gastrointestinal tract, AR, gut microbiota disruption, and the rise of common opportunistic pathogens in hosts.

    "abstract": "The capability of gut microbiota in degrading foods and drugs administered orally can result in diversified efficacies and toxicity interpersonally and cause significant impact on human health. Production of atherogenic trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) from carnitine is a gut microbiota-directed pathway and varies widely among individuals. Here, we demonstrated a personalized TMAO formation and carnitine bioavailability from carnitine supplements by differentiating individual TMAO productivities with a recently developed oral carnitine challenge test (OCCT). By exploring gut microbiome in subjects characterized by TMAO producer phenotypes, we identified 39 operational taxonomy units that were highly correlated to TMAO productivity, including Emergencia timonensis, which has been recently discovered to convert γ-butyrobetaine to TMA in vitro. A microbiome-based random forest classifier was therefore constructed to predict the TMAO producer phenotype (AUROC = 0.81) which was then validated with an external cohort (AUROC = 0.80). A novel bacterium called Ihubacter massiliensis was also discovered to be a key microbe for TMA/TMAO production by using an OCCT-based humanized gnotobiotic mice model. Simply combining the presence of E. timonensis and I. massiliensis could account for 43% of high TMAO producers with 97% specificity. Collectively, this human gut microbiota phenotype-directed approach offers potential for developing precision medicine and provides insights into translational research. Video Abstract.",

Our results show that the gut microbiota profiles of MetS patients are diverse across individuals, but can be classified based on their similarity into three groups or enterotypes. We also showed several associations between species abundance and metabolic parameters that are enterotype specific. These findings suggest that information on the gut microbiota can be useful for assessing treatment options for MetS patients.

    "title": "Gut microbiota maturation during early human life induces enterocyte proliferation via microbial metabolites.",
    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The intestinal tract undergoes a period of cellular maturation during early life, primarily characterized by the organization of epithelial cells into specialized crypt and villus structures. These processes are in part mediated by the acquisition of microbes. Infants delivered at term typically harbor a stable, low diversity microbiota characterized by an overrepresentation of various Bacilli spp., while pre-term infants are colonized by an assortment of bacteria during the first several weeks after delivery. However, the functional effects of these changes on intestinal epithelium homeostasis and maturation remain unclear. To study these effects, human neonate feces were obtained from term and pre-term infants. Fecal 16S rDNA sequencing and global untargeted LC-MS were performed to characterize microbial composition and metabolites from each population. Murine enteral organoids (enteroids) were cultured with 0.22 μm filtered stool supernatant pooled from term or pre-term infants.<h4>Results</h4>Term and pre-term microbial communities differed significantly from each other by principle components analysis (PCoA, PERMANOVA p < 0.001), with the pre-term microbiome characterized by increased OTU diversity (Wilcox test p < 0.01). Term communities were less diverse and dominated by Bacilli (81.54%). Pre-term stools had an increased abundance of vitamins, amino acid derivatives and unconjugated bile acids. Pathway analysis revealed a significant increase in multiple metabolic pathways in pre-term samples mapped to E. coli using the KEGG database related to the fermentation of various amino acids and vitamin biosynthesis. Enteroids cultured with supernatant from pre-term stools proliferated at a higher rate than those cultured with supernatant from term stools (cell viability: 207% vs. 147.7%, p < 0.01), grew larger (area: 81,189μm<sup>2</sup> vs. 41,777μm<sup>2</sup>, p < 0.001), and bud at a higher rate (6.5 vs. 4, p < 0.01). Additionally, genes involved in stem cell proliferation were upregulated in pre-term stool treated enteroid cultures (Lgr5, Ephb2, Ascl2 Sox9) but not term stool treated enteroids.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings indicate that microbial metabolites from the more diverse gut microbiome associated with pre-term infants facilitate stem cell proliferation. Therefore, perturbations of the pre-term microbiota may impair intestinal homeostasis.",

    "title": "The role of gut microbiota in cancer treatment: friend or foe?",
    "abstract": "The gut microbiota has been implicated in cancer and shown to modulate anticancer drug efficacy. Altered gut microbiota is associated with resistance to chemo drugs or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), whereas supplementation of distinct bacterial species restores responses to the anticancer drugs. Accumulating evidence has revealed the potential of modulating the gut microbiota to enhance the efficacy of anticancer drugs. Regardless of the valuable findings by preclinical models and clinical data of patients with cancer, a more thorough understanding of the interactions of the microbiota with cancer therapy helps researchers identify novel strategy for cancer prevention, stratify patients for more effective treatment and reduce treatment complication. In this review, we discuss the scientific evidence on the role of gut microbiota in cancer treatment, and highlight the latest knowledge and technologies leveraged to target specific bacteria that contribute to tumourigenesis. First, we provide an overview of the role of the gut microbiota in cancer, establishing the links between bacteria, inflammation and cancer treatment. Second, we highlight the mechanisms used by distinct bacterial species to modulate cancer growth, immune responses, as well as the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs and ICIs. Third, we demonstrate various approaches to modulate the gut microbiota and their potential in translational research. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current microbiome research in the context of cancer treatment, ongoing efforts to overcome these challenges and future perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Behçet's Syndrome (BS) is a multisystem vasculitis with various clinical manifestations. Pathogenesis is unclear, but studies have shown genetic factors, innate immunity and autoinflammation to have an important role in the disease course. Diversity in the microbial community of gut microbiota may significantly contribute to the activation of the innate immune system. The clinical features of BS present themselves in clusters and each cluster may be a consequence of different disease mechanisms. For this reason we aimed to investigate the gut microbiota of BS patients with uveitis. In addition to healthy controls, we have aimed to compare the gut microbiota of BS with that of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) and Crohn's Disease (CD) as both diseases have innate and autoinflammatory features in their pathogenesis. Seven patients with BS, 12 patients with FMF, 9 patients with CD and 16 healthy controls (HC) were included in the study. Total genomic DNAs were isolated from fecal samples of the patients. Partial 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using the PGM Ion Torrent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for microbiota analysis. Statistical analysis showed that significant differences were detected on the microbial community of four groups. Succinivibrionaceae is dominant and the signature family, whereas Bacteroides was absent in BS patients.",

    "title": "Characterization of gut contractility and microbiota in patients with severe chronic constipation.",
    "abstract": "Chronic constipation (CC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders worldwide. Its pathogenesis, however, remains largely unclear. The purpose of the present work was to gain an insight into the role of contractility and microbiota in the etiology of CC. To this end, we studied spontaneous and evoked contractile activity of descending colon segments from patients that have undergone surgery for refractory forms of CC. The juxta-mucosal microbiota of these colon samples were characterized with culture-based and 16S rRNA sequencing techniques. In patients with CC the spontaneous colonic motility remained unchanged compared to the control group without dysfunction of intestinal motility. Moreover, contractions induced by potassium chloride and carbachol were increased in both circular and longitudinal colonic muscle strips, thus indicating preservation of contractile apparatus and increased sensitivity to cholinergic nerve stimulation in the constipated intestine. In the test group, the gut microbiota composition was assessed as being typically human, with four dominant bacterial phyla, namely Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, as well as usual representation of the most prevalent gut bacterial genera. Yet, significant inter-individual differences were revealed. The phylogenetic diversity of gut microbiota was not affected by age, sex, or colonic anatomy (dolichocolon, megacolon). The abundance of butyrate-producing genera Roseburia, Coprococcus, and Faecalibacterium was low, whereas conventional probiotic genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria were not decreased in the gut microbiomes of the constipated patients. As evidenced by our study, specific microbial biomarkers for constipation state are absent. The results point to a probable role played by the overall gut microbiota at the functional level. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive characterization of CC pathogenesis, finding lack of disruption of motor activity of colonic smooth muscle cells and insufficiency of particular members of gut microbiota usually implicated in CC.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Knowledge is growing on how gut microbiota are established, but the effects of maternal symbiotic microbes throughout early microbial successions in birds remain elusive. In this study, we examined the contributions and transmission modes of maternal microbes into the neonatal microbiota of a passerine, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), based on fostering experiments.<h4>Results</h4>Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we found that zebra finch chicks raised by their biological or foster parents (the society finch Lonchura striata domestica) had gut microbial communities converging with those of the parents that reared them. Moreover, source-tracking models revealed high contribution of zebra finches' oral cavity/crop microbiota to their chicks' early gut microbiota, which were largely replaced by the parental gut microbiota at later stages. The results suggest that oral feeding only affects the early stage of hatchling gut microbial development.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study indicates that passerine chicks mainly acquire symbionts through indirect maternal transmission-passive environmental uptake from nests that were smeared with the intestinal and cloacal microbes of parents that raised them. Gut microbial diversity was low in hand-reared chicks, emphasizing the importance of parental care in shaping the gut microbiota. In addition, several probiotics were found in chicks fostered by society finches, which are excellent foster parents for other finches in bird farms and hosts of brood parasitism by zebra finches in aviaries; this finding implies that avian species that can transfer probiotics to chicks may become selectively preferred hosts of brood parasitism in nature.

    "abstract": "<i>Xiaoqu</i>, one of three traditional <i>jiuqu</i> in China, is a saccharifying and fermenting agent used in <i>Xiaoqu jiu</i> brewing, with different ingredient compositions and preparation techniques used in various regions. The yield and quality of <i>Xiaoqu jiu</i> are significantly affected by the metabolites and microbiota of <i>Xiaoqu</i>; however, the associated relationship remains poorly understood. This study aimed to analyze this relationship in three typical traditional <i>Xiaoqu</i> from the Guizhou province in China. The non-volatile metabolites of <i>Xiaoqu</i> were detected using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry, whereas the classification and metabolic potential of the microbiota were investigated using metagenomic sequencing. Results show that Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria represent the dominant bacterial phyla, with <i>Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Acinetobacter, Leuconostoc</i>, and <i>Weissella</i> found to be the dominant bacterial genera. Meanwhile, Ascomycota, Mucoromycota, and Basidiomycota are the dominant fungal phyla with <i>Aspergillus, Saccharomyces, Pichia, Rhizopus</i>, and <i>Phycomyces</i> being the predominant fungal genera. Functional annotation of the microbiota revealed a major association with metabolism of carbohydrates, cofactors, and vitamins, as well as amino acids. A total of 39 significantly different metabolites (SDMs) were identified that are involved in 47 metabolic pathways, primarily that of starch and sucrose; glycine, serine, and threonine; glyoxylate and dicarboxylate; pyruvate; as well as biosynthesis of pantothenate and CoA. Further, based on Spearman's correlation analysis, <i>Aspergillus, Saccharomyces, Lactobacillus, Acetobacter, Weissella, Pantoea, Desmospora</i>, and <i>Bacillus</i> are closely correlated with production of physicochemical indexes and SDMs. Moreover, the metabolic network generated for the breakdown of substrates and formation of SDMs in <i>Xiaoqu</i> was found to primarily center on the metabolism of carbohydrates and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. These results provide insights into the functional microorganisms and metabolic patterns present in traditional Guizhou <i>Xiaoqu</i> and might guide researchers in the production of stable and efficient <i>Xiaoqu</i> in the future.",

The intestinal microbiota of newborn animals plays a fundamental role in the development of intestinal function and the innate immune system. However, little is currently known about dietary interventions in the gut microbiota and barrier function of livestock, especially suckling Bamei piglets. To this end, we studied the effect of early dietary supplementation on intestinal bacterial communities and intestinal barrier function in piglets.<h4>Results</h4>10 purebred Bamei sows were randomly allocated into two groups. In group one, the piglets received a supplementary milk replacer on day 7 of age, whereas the other control group was allowed sow's milk alone. At 21 days, 18 and 17, respectively, piglets in each group of average weight were randomly selected and sacrificed. Tissue and digesta samples were collected from the jejunum to evaluate differences in the microbiome-metabolome and the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines (TLR4, TNFα and IL-8) and barrier proteins (ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-1). Sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed that ES improved the gut microbiome composition of Bamei suckling piglets. The relative abundances of some bacterial species such as Lactobacillales, Romboutsia, Actinobacillus, Bacteroides were significantly reduced in the ES group. Metabolomics analysis indicated that 23 compounds were enriched and 35 compounds decreased in the ES group. And correlation analysis demonstrated that some gut bacterial genera were highly correlated with altered gut microbiota-related metabolites. Meanwhile, ES of Bamei suckling piglets altered the gene expression of inflammatory cytokine and barrier protein in the jejunum.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In summary, these results provide important insights on the relationships between jejunal microbiota and related metabolites, and jejunal barrier function during the early life of Bamei suckling piglets.",

    "abstract": "Human milk is the optimal nutrition source for infants, and oligosaccharides represent the third most abundant component in milk after lactose and fat. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) are favorable macromolecules which are, interestingly, indigestible by the infant but serve as substrates for bacteria. Hypothesizing that the maternal diet itself might influence HMO composition, we sought to directly determine the effect maternal diet on HMO and the milk bacteria. Employing a human cross-over study design, we demonstrate that distinct maternal dietary carbohydrate and energy sources preferentially alter milk concentrations of HMO, including fucosylated species. We find significant associations between the concentration of HMO-bound fucose and the abundance of fucosidase (a bacterial gene that digests fucose moieties) harbored by milk bacteria. These studies reveal a successive mechanism by which the maternal diet during lactation alters milk HMO composition, which in turn shapes the functional milk microbiome prior to infant ingestion.",

Assembly-based methods are limited by coverage depth, with poor sensitivity for CDS at < 5X depth of sequencing, but have excellent PPV. Mapping-based techniques are more sensitive at low coverage depths, but can struggle with PPV. We additionally describe an expectation maximization based iterative algorithmic approach which we show to successfully improve the PPV of a mapping based technique while retaining improved sensitivity and computational efficiency.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our benchmarking approach reveals the trade-offs of assembly versus alignment-based approaches and the relative performance of specific implementations when one wishes to extract the protein coding capacity of microbial communities.",

Advances in high-throughput sequencing technology and functional studies have provided significant insights into the landscape of the gut microbiome and the fundamental roles of its components in carcinogenesis. Integration of scattered knowledge is highly beneficial for future progress. In this study, literature review and information extraction were performed, with the aim of integrating the available data resources and facilitating comparative research. A knowledgebase of the human CRC microbiome was compiled to facilitate understanding of diagnosis, and the global signatures of CRC microbes, sample types, algorithms, differential microorganisms and various panels of markers plus their diagnostic performance were evaluated based on statistical and phylogenetic analyses. Additionally, prospects about current changelings and solution strategies were outlined for identifying future research directions. This type of data integration strategy presents an effective platform for inquiry and comparison of relevant information, providing a tool for further study about CRC-related microbes and exploration of factors promoting clinical transformation (available at: http://gsbios.com/index/experimental/dts_ mben?id=1).",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The gut microbiota can have dramatic effects on host metabolism; however, current genomic strategies for uncultured bacteria have several limitations that hinder their ability to identify responders to metabolic changes in the microbiota. In this study, we describe a novel single-cell genomic sequencing technique that can identify metabolic responders at the species level without the need for reference genomes, and apply this method to identify bacterial responders to an inulin-based diet in the mouse gut microbiota.<h4>Results</h4>Inulin-feeding changed the mouse fecal microbiome composition to increase Bacteroides spp., resulting in the production of abundant succinate in the mouse intestine. Using our massively parallel single-cell genome sequencing technique, named SAG-gel platform, we obtained 346 single-amplified genomes (SAGs) from mouse gut microbes before and after dietary inulin supplementation. After quality control, the SAGs were classified as 267 bacteria, spanning 2 phyla, 4 classes, 7 orders, and 14 families, and 31 different strains of SAGs were graded as high- and medium-quality draft genomes. From these, we have successfully obtained the genomes of the dominant inulin-responders, Bacteroides spp., and identified their polysaccharide utilization loci and their specific metabolic pathways for succinate production.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our single-cell genomics approach generated a massive amount of SAGs, enabling a functional analysis of uncultured bacteria in the intestinal microbiome. This enabled us to estimate metabolic lineages involved in the bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber and metabolic outcomes such as short-chain fatty acid production in the intestinal environment based on the fibers ingested. The technique allows the in-depth isolation and characterization of uncultured bacteria with specific functions in the microbiota and could be exploited to improve human and animal health.

The aim of the study is to characterise relationships between the intestinal microbiome composition, uraemic toxins and renal failure symptoms in human end-stage renal disease (ESRD).<h4>Design</h4>Characterisation of gut microbiome, serum and faecal metabolome and human phenotypes in a cohort of 223 patients with ESRD and 69 healthy controls. Multidimensional data integration to reveal links between these datasets and the use of chronic kidney disease (CKD) rodent models to test the effects of intestinal microbiome on toxin accumulation and disease severity.<h4>Results</h4>A group of microbial species enriched in ESRD correlates tightly to patient clinical variables and encode functions involved in toxin and secondary bile acids synthesis; the relative abundance of the microbial functions correlates with the serum or faecal concentrations of these metabolites. Microbiota from patients transplanted to renal injured germ-free mice or antibiotic-treated rats induce higher production of serum uraemic toxins and aggravated renal fibrosis and oxidative stress more than microbiota from controls. Two of the species, <i>Eggerthella lenta</i> and <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i>, increase uraemic toxins production and promote renal disease development in a CKD rat model. A probiotic <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> decreases abundance of these species, reduces levels of toxins and the severity of the disease in rats.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Aberrant gut microbiota in patients with ESRD sculpts a detrimental metabolome aggravating clinical outcomes, suggesting that the gut microbiota will be a promising target for diminishing uraemic toxicity in those patients.<h4>Trial registration number</h4>This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03010696).",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated skin disorder. Imbalance of gut microbial populations has been implicated in many diseases. We aimed to investigate whether there were differences in gut microbiota in psoriasis patients vs non-psoriasis controls and between psoriasis severity groups. 55 psoriasis patients and 27 controls were included. V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene of fecal samples were analyzed using Illumina MiSeq. Bioinformatic analysis was performed. We found changes in gut microbiome composition depending on their psoriasis status as determined by weighted unifrac (p < 0.05), in particular an increase in Firmicutes and depletion of Bacteroidetes in psoriasis patients. Additionally, the Faecalibacterium and Blautia genus were higher in psoriasis patients while Bacteroides and Paraprevotella in non-psoriasis controls (p < 0.05, LDA score > 2). Moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients had lower biodiversity than mild psoriatic patients (p = 0.049). No differences for beta-diversity were found. We developed a Psoriasis-Microbiota Index (PMI), which discriminated among psoriasis patients and controls with sensitivity: 0.78 and specificity: 0.79. Furthermore, we performed a meta-analysis with published data to validate this index. We demonstrated gut dysbiosis in psoriasis patients, suggesting a role in psoriasis pathophysiology. Furthermore, we developed a PMI with the potential to discriminate between psoriasis patients and controls across different populations, which could be used as a biomarker in the clinical practice.",

In this narrative review, we discuss how big data integration and machine learning have been applied to translational IBD research. Approaches such as machine learning may enable patient stratification, prediction of disease progression and therapy responses for fine-tuning treatment options with positive impacts on cost, health and safety. We also outline the challenges and opportunities presented by machine learning and big data in clinical IBD research.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we present our three-class course sequence to educate students about microbiome analysis and metagenomics through experiential learning by taking them from inquiry to analysis of the microbiome: Molecular Ecology Lab, Bioinformatics, and Computational Microbiome Analysis. Students developed hypotheses, designed lab experiments, sequenced the DNA from microbiomes, learned basic python/R scripting, became proficient in at least one microbiome analysis software, and were able to analyze data generated from the microbiome experiments. While over 150 students (graduate and undergraduate) were impacted by the development of the series of courses, our assessment was only on undergraduate learning, where 45 students enrolled in at least one of the three courses and 4 students took all three. Students gained skills in bioinformatics through the courses, and several positive comments were received through surveys and private correspondence. Through a summative assessment, general trends show that students became more proficient in comparative genomic techniques and had positive attitudes toward their abilities to bridge biology and bioinformatics. While most students took individual or 2 of the courses, we show that pre- and post-surveys of these individual classes still showed progress toward learning objectives. It is expected that students trained will enter the workforce with skills needed to innovate in the biotechnology, health, and environmental industries. Students are trained to maximize impact and tackle real world problems in biology and medicine with their learned knowledge of data science and machine learning.

We used the MinION platform coupled to the NanoOK RT software package to perform shotgun metagenomic sequencing and profile mock communities and faecal samples from healthy and ill preterm infants. Using Nanopore data, we reliably classified a 20-species mock community and captured the diversity of the immature gut microbiota over time and in response to interventions such as probiotic supplementation, antibiotic treatment or episodes of suspected sepsis. We also performed rapid real-time runs to assess gut-associated microbial communities in critically ill and healthy infants, facilitated by NanoOK RT software package, which analysed sequences as they were generated. Our pipeline reliably identified pathogenic bacteria (that is, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) and their corresponding antimicrobial resistance gene profiles within as little as 1 h of sequencing. Results were confirmed using pathogen isolation, whole-genome sequencing and antibiotic susceptibility testing, as well as mock communities and clinical samples with known antimicrobial resistance genes. Our results demonstrate that MinION (including cost-effective Flongle flow cells) with NanoOK RT can process metagenomic samples to a rich dataset in < 5 h, which creates a platform for future studies aimed at developing these tools and approaches in clinical settings with a focus on providing tailored patient antimicrobial treatment options.",

    "abstract": "The community of microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of monogastric herbivores played critical roles in the absorption of nutrients and keeping the host healthy. However, its establishment at different age groups has not been quantitatively and functionally examined. The knowledge of microbial colonization and its function in the intestinal tract of different-age donkeys is still limited. By applying the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and functional prediction on fecal samples from different-age donkeys, we characterized the gut microbiota during the different age groups. In contrast to the adult donkeys, the gut microbiota diversity and richness of the young donkeys showed significantly less resemblance. The microbial data showed that diversity and richness increased with age, but a highly individual variation of microbial composition was observed at month 1. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) revealed a significant difference across five time points in the feces. The abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Odoribacter</i> tended to decrease, while the proportion of <i>Streptococcus</i> was significantly increased with age. For functional prediction, the relative abundance of pathways had a significant difference in the feces across different age groups, for example, Terpenoids and Polyketides and Folding, Sorting, and Degradation (<i>P</i> < 0.05 or <i>P</i> < 0.01). The analysis of beta diversity (PCoA and LEfSe) and microbial functions predicted with PICRUSt (NSTIs) clearly divided the donkeys into foals (≤3 months old) and adults (≥7 months old). Microbial community composition and structure had distinctive features at each age group, in accordance with functional stability of the microbiota. Our findings established a framework for understanding the composition and function of the fecal microbiota to differ between young and adult donkeys.",

    "abstract": "Microbiome research has increased dramatically in recent years, driven by advances in technology and significant reductions in the cost of analysis. Such research has unlocked a wealth of data, which has yielded tremendous insight into the nature of the microbial communities, including their interactions and effects, both within a host and in an external environment as part of an ecological community. Understanding the role of microbiota, including their dynamic interactions with their hosts and other microbes, can enable the engineering of new diagnostic techniques and interventional strategies that can be used in a diverse spectrum of fields, spanning from ecology and agriculture to medicine and from forensics to exobiology. From June 19-23 in 2017, the NIH and NSF jointly held an Innovation Lab on <i>Quantitative Approaches to Biomedical Data Science Challenges in our Understanding of the Microbiome</i>. This review is inspired by some of the topics that arose as priority areas from this unique, interactive workshop. The goal of this review is to summarize the Innovation Lab's findings by introducing the reader to emerging challenges, exciting potential, and current directions in microbiome research. The review is broken into five key topic areas: (1) interactions between microbes and the human body, (2) evolution and ecology of microbes, including the role played by the environment and microbe-microbe interactions, (3) analytical and mathematical methods currently used in microbiome research, (4) leveraging knowledge of microbial composition and interactions to develop engineering solutions, and (5) interventional approaches and engineered microbiota that may be enabled by selectively altering microbial composition. As such, this review seeks to arm the reader with a broad understanding of the priorities and challenges in microbiome research today and provide inspiration for future investigation and multi-disciplinary collaboration.",

    "title": "A comparative study of the gut microbiome in Egyptian patients with Type I and Type II diabetes.",
    "abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Diabetes remains a growing public health concern in Egypt, as prevalence of Type II diabetes (TIID) has nearly tripled there in the last two decades. Egypt was ranked ninth worldwide in number of diabetes cases, with prevalence of 15.56% among adults. Recent studies have proposed that disturbance of gut microbiota could influence TIID development and indicated associations between a reduced diversity in microbiomes and Type I diabetes (TID). In the present study, we investigated the composition and abundance of the bacterial microbiome in disease state (TID and TIID) of Egyptian patients. Our goal in this study was to characterize features of the gut microbiota and possible differences associated with TID and TIID in this population.<h4>Methods</h4>DNA was extracted from fecal samples taken from 22 TID and 18 TIID outpatients of Al-Hussein hospital, Cairo, Egypt. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to characterize the bacterial taxa and these reads were processed using the software mothur with analysis utilizing packages vegan, phyloseq and metagenomSeq in R.<h4>Results and conclusions</h4>Our results highlighted a significant increase in abundance of Gram negative, potentially opportunistic pathogenic taxa (Pseudomonas, Prevotella) in all diabetic groups, compared to the control. Lipopolysccharide (LPS), a component of the gram-negative bacterial wall, can activate local immune response and may result in low-grade systemic inflammation contributing to insulin resistance. The gram-positive Gemella, which is associated with increased risk to diabetes, also had a significant increase in abundance in all diabetic groups, compared to the control. In contrast, the commensal bacterial taxa Turicibacter, Terrisporobacter and Clostridium were found to be more abundant in the control group than in TID. Further studies are needed to understand the role of these taxa in health and disease. Lower Richness and low Shannon diversity, though not statistically significant, were observed for TID subjects with no glucose control and with onset of liver disease or hypertension compared to other subjects. In addition, large variation in alpha diversity within the control group could also be observed. Future studies will include larger samples sizes to further elucidate these findings, as well as possible metagenomic studies to examine the intriguing function of significant microbes.",

This condition arises from the interaction between hyperproliferative keratinocytes and infiltrating immune cells, with poor prognosis and high recurrence.

There is much evidence that alterations in the skin and intestinal microbiome play an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, and restoration of the microbiome is a promising preventive and therapeutic strategy for psoriasis.

    "abstract": "There are many examples of symbiotic and reciprocal relationships in ecological systems; animal gut microbiome-host interactions are one such kind of bidirectional and complex relationship. Here, we utilized several approaches (16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics, and transcriptomics) to explore potential gut microbiome-host interactions accompanying the development of gastrointestinal complexity and a dietary shift from metamorphosis to maturity in ornamented pygmy frogs (<i>Microhyla fissipes</i>). We identified the possible coevolution between a particular gut microbial group (increased putative fat-digesting Erysipelotrichaceae and chitin-digesting <i>Bacteroides</i> and Ruminococcaceae) and the host dietary shift [from herbivore to insectivore (high proportion of dietary chitin and fat)] during metamorphosis. We also found that the remodeling and complexity of the gastrointestinal system during metamorphosis might have a profound effect on the gut microbial community (decreasing facultative anaerobic Proteobacteria and increasing anaerobic Firmicutes) and its putative oxygen-related phenotypes. Moreover, a high proportion of chitin-digesting bacteria and increased carbohydrate metabolism by gut microbiomes at the climax of metamorphosis would help the frog's nutrition and energy needs during metamorphosis and development. Considering the increased expression of particular host genes (e.g., chitinase) in juvenile frogs, we speculate that host plays an important role in amphibian metamorphosis, and their symbiotic gut microbiome may help in this process by providing the nutrition and energy needs. We provide this basic information for the amphibian conservation and managements.",

    "abstract": "Gut dysbiosis and microbial translocation are associated with chronic systemic immune activation and inflammation in HIV-1 infection. However, the extent of restoration of gut microbiota in HIV-1 patients with short or long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) is unclear. To understand the impact of ART on the gut microbiota, we used the rhesus macaque model of SIV infection to characterize and compare the gut microbial community upon SIV infection and during ART. We observed altered taxonomic compositions of gut microbiota communities upon SIV infection and at different time points of ART. SIV-infected animals showed decreased diversity of gut microbiome composition, while the ART group appeared to recover towards the diversity level of the healthy control. Animals undergoing ART for various lengths of time were observed to have differential gut bacterial abundance across different time points. In addition, increased blood lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels during SIV infection were reduced to near normal upon ART, indicating that microbial translocation and immune activation can be improved during therapy. In conclusion, while short ART may be related to transient increase of certain pathogenic bacterial microbiome, ART may promote microbiome diversity compromised by SIV infection, improve the gut microbiota towards the healthy compositions and alleviate immune activation.",

We characterized the impact of <i>C. parvum</i> infection on the goat kid microbiome. <i>C. parvum</i> was orally administered to parasite-naïve goats, and infection was monitored for 26 days in fecal samples using immunofluorescence assay and qPCR tests. Age-matched goats served as uninfected controls. A reduction in body weight gain, diarrhea, and dehydration were observed in infected goats compared to the uninfected controls. Infection decreased the bacterial diversity 5 days post-infection (dpi), but this parameter recovered at 15 dpi. The infection altered the relative abundance of several taxa. A total of 38 taxa displayed significant differences in abundance between control and infected goats at both 5 and 15 dpi. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that the infection resulted in a differential pattern of taxa interactions and that <i>C. parvum</i> infection increased the relative abundance of specific taxa. The 16S data set was used for metagenome predictions using the software package PICRUSt2. As many as 34 and 40 MetaCyc pathways (from 387 total) were significantly affected by the infection at 5 and 15 dpi, respectively. Notably, <i>C. parvum</i> decreased the abundance of butyrate-producing pathways in bacteria. Low levels of butyrate may increase mucosal inflammation and tissue repair. Our results suggest that the gut inflammation induced by <i>C. parvum</i> infection is associated with the reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria. This insight could be the basis for the development of novel control strategies to improve animal health.",

    "abstract": "To date, reliable tests enabling the identification of celiac disease (CD) patients at a greater risk of developing poly-autoimmune diseases are not yet available. We therefore aimed to identify non-invasive microbial biomarkers, useful to implement diagnosis of poly-autoimmunity. Twenty CD patients with poly-autoimmunity (cases) and 30 matched subjects affected exclusively by CD (controls) were selected. All patients followed a varied gluten-free diet for at least 1 year. Fecal microbiota composition was characterized using bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Significant differences in gut microbiota composition between CD patients with and without poly-autoimmune disease were found using the edgeR algorithm. Spearman correlations between gut microbiota and clinical, demographic, and anthropometric data were also examined. A significant reduction of <i>Bacteroides, Ruminococcus</i>, and <i>Veillonella</i> abundances was found in CD patients with poly-autoimmunity compared to the controls. <i>Bifidobacterium</i> was specifically reduced in CD patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and its abundance correlated negatively with abdominal circumference values in patients affected exclusively by CD. In addition, the duration of CD correlated with the abundance of Firmicutes (negatively) and <i>Odoribacter</i> (positively), whereas the abundance of <i>Desulfovibrionaceae</i> correlated positively with the duration of poly-autoimmunity. This study provides supportive evidence that specific variations of gut microbial taxa occur in CD patients with poly-autoimmune diseases. These findings open the way to future validation studies on larger cohorts, which might in turn lead to promising diagnostic applications.",

Between 66 and 93% of patients with CU have chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), the precise pathogenesis of which is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between gut microbiota and serum metabolites and the possible pathogenesis underlying CSU. We collected feces and blood samples from CSU patients and healthy controls and the relationship between gut microbiota and serum metabolites was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomic analyses. The CSU group exhibited decreased alpha diversity of the microbial population compared to the control group. The abundance of unidentified <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> was increased, while the abundance of <i>Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium</i>, and unidentified <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> was significantly reduced in CSU patients. The serum metabolome analysis revealed altered levels of docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, glutamate, and succinic acid, suggesting changes in unsaturated fatty acids and the butanoate metabolism pathway. The combined serum metabolomics and gut microbiome datasets were correlated; specifically, docosahexaenoic acid, and arachidonic acid were positively correlated with <i>Bacteroides</i>. We speculate that alterations in gut microbes and metabolites may contribute to exacerbated inflammatory responses and dysregulated immune function with or without regulatory T cell dependence in the pathogenesis of CSU.",

Little is known about microbial contributions to laryngeal epithelial health and pathogenesis. Developing a gnotobiotic laryngeal model will introduce new avenues for targeted explorations of microbes in laryngeal mucosal biology, allowing for enhanced understanding of host-microbe interaction in the upper airway. In this study, we first assessed the potential of using gut microbiota as a source to establish laryngeal microbiota in germ-free mice. Results demonstrated the selective nature of the upper airway and provided evidence that gut bacteria can assemble into communities that resemble the commensal resident bacteria occurring in the larynx of conventionally-raised animals phylogenetically and functionally. Then, we confirmed the reproducibility of laryngeal colonization through comparison of laryngeal microbiota in the larynx along with neighboring regions (base of tongue, esophagus, and trachea) between conventionally-raised and germ-free mice that conventionalized with cecal microbiota. Despite taxonomic differences, the established laryngeal microbiota from cecal content exhibited similarity to commensal resident microbiota in diversity within/between communities and predicted metagenomic functions. Our data also suggests little difference in bacterial distribution across the larynx and its surrounding regions and that cell motility and the ability to degrade xenobiotics is critical for bacteria colonizing upper airway. Successful colonization of laryngeal and oropharyngeal regions with gut microbiota in our study will greatly facilitate the investigation of potential localized inflammatory responses within host tissues that contribute to the disorders of essential laryngeal functions. Utilizing said gnotobiotic model to conduct future studies will allow for novel insights into direct microbial contributions to laryngeal epithelial health and pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota composition of intensive care unit (ICU) patients suffering from <i>Clostridium difficile</i>-positive diarrhea (CDpD) is poorly understood. This prospective study aims to use 16S rDNA (and metagenome) sequencing to compare the microbiota composition of 58 (and 5) ICU patients with CDpD (CDpD group), 33 (and 4) ICU patients with <i>C. difficile</i>-negative diarrhea (CDnD group), and 21 (and 5) healthy control subjects (control group), as well as CDpD patients in the A<sup>+</sup>B<sup>+</sup> (<i>N</i> = 34; A/B: <i>C. difficile TcdA/B</i>), A<sup>-</sup>B<sup>+</sup> (<i>N</i> = 7), and A<sup>-</sup>B<sup>-</sup> (<i>N</i> = 17) subgroups. For 16S rDNA data, OTU clustering (tool: UPARSE), taxonomic assignment (tool: RDP classifier), α-diversity, and β-diversity analyses (tool: QIIME) were conducted. For metagenome data, metagenome assembly (tool: SOAPdenovo), gene calling (tools: MetaGeneMark, CD-HIT, and SoapAligner), unigene alignment (tool: DIAMOND), taxon difference analysis (tool: Metastats), and gene annotation (tool: DIAMOND) were performed. The microbial diversity of the CDpD group was lower than that of the CDnD and control groups. The abundances of 10 taxa (e.g., Deferribacteres, Cryptomycota, Acetothermia) were significantly higher in the CDpD group than in the CDnD group. The abundances of Saccharomycetes and Clostridia were significantly lower in CDpD in comparison with control. Some taxa were significantly different between the A<sup>+</sup>B<sup>+</sup> and A<sup>-</sup>B<sup>-</sup> subgroups. CDpD might relate to a decrease in beneficial taxa (i.e., Saccharomycetes and Clostridia) and an increase in harmful taxa (e.g., Deferribacteres, Cryptomycota, Acetothermia) in gut microbiota of ICU patients. <i>C. difficile</i> toxin type might be slightly associated with gut microbiota composition.",

    "abstract": "Fundamental restoration ecology and community ecology theories can help us better understand the underlying mechanisms of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and to better design future microbial therapeutics for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections (rCDI) and other dysbiosis-related conditions. In this study, stool samples were collected from donors and rCDI patients one week prior to FMT (pre-FMT), as well as from patients one week following FMT (post-FMT). Using metagenomic sequencing and machine learning, our results suggested that FMT outcome is not only dependent on the ecological structure of the recipients, but also the interactions between the donor and recipient microbiomes at the taxonomical and functional levels. We observed that the presence of specific bacteria in donors (Clostridioides spp., Desulfovibrio spp., Odoribacter spp. and Oscillibacter spp.) and the absence of fungi (Yarrowia spp.) and bacteria (Wigglesworthia spp.) in recipients prior to FMT could predict FMT success. Our results also suggested a series of interlocked mechanisms for FMT success, including the repair of the disturbed gut ecosystem by transient colonization of nexus species followed by secondary succession of bile acid metabolizers, sporulators, and short chain fatty acid producers.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiota is an important component in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD), promoting host-microbe imbalances and disturbing intestinal and immune homeostasis. We aimed to assess the potential clinical usefulness of the colonic tissue microbiome for obtaining biomarkers for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract involvement in CD. We analyzed colonic tissue samples from 26 CD patients (13 with and 13 without UGI involvement at diagnosis) from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi-Omics Database. QIIME1, DiTaxa, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), and PICRUSt2 methods were used to examine microbial dysbiosis. Linear support vector machine (SVM) and random forest classifier (RF) algorithms were used to identify the UGI tract involvement-associated biomarkers. There were no statistically significant differences in community richness, phylogenetic diversity, and phylogenetic distance between the two groups of CD patients. DiTaxa analysis predicted significant association of the species <i>Ruminococcus torques</i> with UGI involvement, which was confirmed by the LEfSe analysis (<i>P</i> = 0.025). For the feature ranking method in both linear SVM and RF models, the species <i>R. torques</i> and age at diagnosis contributed to the combined models. The L-methionine biosynthesis III (<i>P</i> = 0.038) and palmitate biosynthesis II (<i>P</i> = 0.050) were under-represented in CD with UGI involvement. These findings suggest that <i>R. torques</i> might serve as a novel potential biomarker for UGI involvement in CD and its correlations, in addition to a range of bacterial species. The mechanisms of interaction between hosts and <i>R. torques</i> should be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous steroid hormones and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDC) interact with gut microbiota through different pathways. We suggest the use of the term \"endobolome\" when referring to the group of gut microbiota genes and pathways involved in the metabolism of steroid hormones and EDC. States of dysbiosis and reduced diversity of the gut microbiota may impact and modify the endobolome resulting at long-term in the development of certain pathophysiological conditions. The endobolome might play a central role in the gut microbiota as seen by the amount of potentially endobolome-mediated diseases and thereby it can be considered an useful diagnostic tool and therapeutic target for future functional research strategies that envisage the use of next generation of probiotics. In addition, we propose that EDC and other xenobiotics that alter the gut microbial composition and its metabolic capacities should be categorized into a subgroup termed \"microbiota disrupting chemicals\" (MDC). This will help to distinguish the role of contaminants from other microbiota natural modifiers such as those contained or released from diet, environment, physical activity and stress. These MDC might have the ability to promote specific changes in the microbiota that can ultimately result in common intestinal and chronic or long-term systemic diseases in the host. The risk of developing certain disorders associated with gut microbiota changes should be established by determining both the effects of the MDC on gut microbiota and the impact of microbiota changes on chemicals metabolism and host susceptibility. In any case, further animal controlled experiments, clinical trials and large epidemiological studies are required in order to establish the concatenated impact of the MDC-microbiota-host health axis.",

    "abstract": "The steady increase in life-expectancy of world population, coupled to many genetic and environmental factors (for instance, pre- and post-natal exposures to environmental neurotoxins), predispose to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, whose prevalence is expected to increase dramatically in the next years. Recent studies have proposed links between the gut microbiota and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Human body is a complex structure where bacterial and human cells are almost equal in numbers, and most microbes are metabolically active in the gut, where they potentially influence other target organs, including the brain. The role of gut microbiota in the development and pathophysiology of the human brain is an area of growing interest for the scientific community. Several microbial-derived neurochemicals involved in the gut-microbiota-brain crosstalk seem implicated in the biological and physiological basis of neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. Evidence supporting these connections has come from model systems, but there are still unsolved issues due to several limitations of available research tools. New technologies are recently born to help understanding the causative role of gut microbes in neurodegeneration. This review aims to make an overview of recent advances in the study of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the field of neurodegenerative disorders by: (a) identifying specific microbial pathological signaling pathways; (b) characterizing new, advanced engineered tools to study the interactions between human cells and gut bacteria.",

Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiome can influence the development of chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea. Here we report findings from a randomised clinical trial of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to treat diarrhoea induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04040712). The primary outcome is the resolution of diarrhoea four weeks after the end of treatments. Twenty patients are randomised to receive FMT from healthy donors or placebo FMT (vehicle only). Donor FMT is more effective than placebo FMT in treating TKI-induced diarrhoea, and a successful engraftment is observed in subjects receiving donor faeces. No serious adverse events are observed in both treatment arms. The trial meets pre-specified endpoints. Our findings suggest that the therapeutic manipulation of gut microbiota may become a promising treatment option to manage TKI-dependent diarrhoea.",

    "abstract": "Altered composition of the gut microbiota has been observed in many neurodegenerative diseases. LanCL1 has been proven to protect neurons and reduce oxidative stress. The present study was designed to investigate alterations of the gut microbiota in LanCL1 knockout mice and to study the interactions between gut bacteria and the brain. Wild-type and LanCL1 knockout mice on a normal chow diet were evaluated at 4 and 8-9 weeks of age. 16s rRNA sequence and untargeted metabolomics analyses were performed to investigate changes in the gut microbiota and feces metabolites. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, AB-PAS staining, and a TUNEL assay were performed to detect alterations in the gut and brain of knockout mice. The serum cytokines of 9-week-old knockout mice, which were detected by a multiplex cytokine assay, were significantly increased. In the central nervous system, there was no increase of antioxidant defense genes even though there was only low activity of glutathione S-transferase in the brain of 8-week-old knockout mice. Interestingly, the gut tight junctions, zonula occludens-1 and occludin, also displayed a downregulated expression level in 8-week-old knockout mice. On the contrary, the production of mucus increased in 8-week-old knockout mice. Moreover, the compositions of the gut microbiota and feces metabolites markedly changed in 8-week-old knockout mice but not in 4-week-old mice. Linear discriminant analysis and <i>t</i>-tests identified <i>Akkermansia</i> as a specific abundant bacteria in knockout mice. Quite a few feces metabolites that have protective effects on the brain were reduced in 8-week-old knockout mice. However, N-acetylsphingosine was the most significant downregulated feces metabolite, which may cause the postponement of neuronal apoptosis. To further investigate the effect of the gut microbiota, antibiotics treatment was given to both types of mice from 5 to 11 weeks of age. After treatment, a significant increase of oxidative damage in the brain of knockout mice was observed, which may have been alleviated by the gut microbiota before. In conclusion, alterations of the gut microbiota and feces metabolites alleviated oxidative damage to the brain of LanCL1 knockout mice, revealing that an endogenous feedback loop mechanism of the microbiota-gut-brain axis maintains systemic homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The study of the gut microbiota-brain axis has become an intriguing field, attracting attention from both gastroenterologists and neurobiologists. The hippocampus is the center of learning and memory, and plays a pivotal role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies using diet administration, antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, germ-free mice, and fecal analysis of normal and specific pathogen-free animals have shown that the structure and function of the hippocampus are affected by the gut microbiota. Furthermore, hippocampal pathologies in AD are positively correlated with changes in specific microbiota. Genomic and neurochemical analyses revealed significant alterations in genes and amino acids in the hippocampus of AD subjects following a remarkable shift in the gut microbiota. In a recent study, when young animals were transplanted with fecal microbiota derived from AD patients, the recipients showed significant impairment of cognitive behaviors, AD pathologies, and changes in neuronal plasticity and cytokines. Other studies have demonstrated the side effects of antibiotic administration along with the beneficial effects of probiotics, prebiotics, and specific diets on the composition of the gut microbiota and hippocampal functions, but these have been mostly preliminary with unclear mechanisms. Since some specific gut bacteria are positively or negatively correlated to the structure and function of the hippocampus, it is expected that specific gut bacteria administration and other microbiota-based interventions could be potentially applied to prevent or treat hippocampus-based memory impairment and neuropsychiatric disorders such as AD.",

    "abstract": "Domestic yaks (<i>Bos grunniens</i>) are indigenous to the Tibetan Plateau and display a high diarrhea rate due to poor habitat and husbandry conditions. <i>Lactobacillus</i> has been shown to exert beneficial effects as antimicrobial, growth promotion, and gut microbiota in humans and/or murine models, but the relevant data regarding <i>Lactobacillus</i> isolated from yaks was unavailable. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of <i>Lactobacillus</i> from yaks on the intestinal microbial community in a mouse model and determine whether <i>Lactobacillus</i> supplementation contributed in alleviating diarrhea by modulating gut microbiota. A total of 12 ileac samples from four groups were collected for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of V3-V4 region. Results revealed that although <i>Lactobacillus</i> supplementation did not change the diversity of gut microbiota in mice, the proportion of some intestinal microbiota significantly changed. Specifically, the proportion of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Sphingomonas</i> in the <i>Lactobacillus</i> treated-group (L-group) were increased as compared to control group (C-group), whereas <i>Pantoea</i>, <i>Cutibacterium</i>, <i>Glutamicibacter</i>, <i>Turicibacter</i>, <i>Globicatella</i>, <i>Microbacterium</i>, <i>Facklamia</i>, <i>unidentified_Corynebacteriaceae</i>, <i>Brachybacterium</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus</i> were significantly decreased in the L-group. In contrast, <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) infection significantly decreased the proportion of beneficial bacteria such as <i>Globicatella</i>, <i>Acinetobacter</i>, <i>Aerococcus</i>, and <i>Comamonas</i>, while loads of pathogenic bacteria significantly increased including <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Megasphaera</i>. Interestingly, <i>Lactobacillus</i> administration could ameliorate the microbial community structure of <i>E. coli</i>-induced diarrheal mice by reducing the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria such as <i>Paenibacillus</i>, <i>Aerococcus</i>, <i>Comamonas</i>, <i>Acinetobacter</i>, <i>Corynebacterium</i>, <i>Facklamia</i>, and <i>Globicatella</i>. Results in this study revealed that <i>Lactobacillus</i> supplementation not only improved the gut microbiota but also alleviated diarrhea in mice, which may be mediated by modulating the composition and function of gut microbiota.

    "abstract": "Trace amines (TA) are endogenously produced in mammals, have a low concentration in the central nervous system (CNS), but trigger a variety of neurological effects and intervene in host cell communication. It emerged that neurotransmitters and TA are produced also by the microbiota. As it has been shown that TA contribute to wound healing, we examined the skin microbiome of probands using shotgun metagenomics. The phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were predominant. Since SadA is a highly promiscuous TA-producing decarboxylase in Firmicutes, the skin microbiome was specifically examined for the presence of <i>sadA</i>-homologous genes. By mapping the reads of certain genes, we found that, although there were less reads mapping to <i>sadA</i> than to ubiquitous housekeeping genes (<i>arcC</i> and <i>mutS</i>), normalized reads counts were still >1000 times higher than those of rare control genes (<i>icaA</i>, <i>icaB</i>, and <i>epiA</i>). At protein sequence level SadA homologs were found in at least 7 phyla: Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Cyanobacteria, and in 23 genera of the phylum Firmicutes. A high proportion of the genera that have a SadA homolog belong to the classical skin and intestinal microbiota. The distribution of <i>sadA</i> in so many different phyla illustrates the importance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). We show that the <i>sadA</i> gene is widely distributed in the human skin microbiome. When comparing the <i>sadA</i> read counts in the probands, there was no correlation between age and gender, but an enormous difference in the <i>sadA</i> read counts in the microbiome of the individuals. Since <i>sadA</i> is involved in TA synthesis, it is likely that the TA content of the skin is correlated with the amount of TA producing bacteria in the microbiome. In this way, the microbiome-generated TA could influence signal transmission in the epithelial and nervous system.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Numerous studies have reported the health-promoting effects of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) in in vitro models; however, a functional evaluation of EPSs will provide additional knowledge of EPS-microbe interactions by in vivo intestinal microbial model. In the present study, high-throughput amplicon sequencing, short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) and intestinal inflammation evaluation were performed to explore the potential benefits of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) and EPS-producing Lactobacillus (HNUB20 group) using the healthy zebrafish (Danio rerio) model.<h4>Results</h4>The results based on microbial taxonomic analysis revealed that the abundance of four genera, Ochrobactrum, Sediminibacterium, Sphingomonas and Sphingobium, were increased in the control group in comparison to HNUB20 group. Pelomonas spp. levels were significantly higher and that of the genera Lactobacillus and Brachybacterium were significantly decreased in EPS group compared with control group. PICRUSt based functional prediction of gut microbiota metabolic pathways indicated that significantly lower abundance was found for transcription, and membrane transport, whereas folding, sorting and degradation and energy metabolism had significantly higher abundance after HNUB20 treatment. Two metabolic pathways, including metabolism and endocrine functions, were more abundant in the EPS group than control group. Similar to the HNUB20 group, transcription was also decreased in the EPS group compared with the control group. However, SCFAs and immune indexes indicated EPS and HNUB20 performed limited efficacy in the healthy zebrafish.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present intestinal microbial model-based study indicated that EPSs and high-yield EPS-producing Lactobacillus can shake the structure of intestinal microbiota, but cannot change SCFAs presence and intestinal inflammation.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Early introduction of complementary foods has been associated with various immune disorders, oxidative stress, and obesity in childhood. The gut microbiota and the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) they produce are postulated to be on the causal pathway. The objective of this study was to determine if early complementary feeding (i.e. consumption of solids or non-water/formula liquids at or before 3 months) is prospectively associated with infant gut microbiota composition, diversity and SCFAs at 3 and 12 months of age in the Nurture birth cohort.<h4>Results</h4>Mother-infant dyads in the early complementary feeding group (n = 18) had similar baseline characteristics to those in the later feeding group (n = 49). We assessed differential abundance of microbial taxa (measured by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V4 region) by timing of complementary feeding using beta-binomial regression models (considering a two-sided FDR corrected p-value of < 0.05 as significant), and we fittted linear regression models to assess the association between early complementary feeding and SCFA concentrations (quantified using gas chromatography). After multivariable adjustment for breastfeeding, delivery method, birth weight, and gestational age, there were 13 differentially abundant microbial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) by timing of introduction to complementary foods at 3 months and 20 ASVs at 12 months. Infants introduced to complementary foods early (vs. later) had higher concentrations of the SCFA butyric acid (mean difference = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.27, 1.04, p < 0.01) and total SCFAs (mean difference = 38.8, 95% CI: 7.83, 69.7) at 12 months. Bilophila wadsworthia and Lachnospiraceae Roseburia were associated with early (vs. later) complementary feeding and with higher butyric acid concentrations at 3 and 12 months, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that early (vs. later) introduction to complementary foods is associated with altered gut microbiota composition and butyric acid concentrations measured in stool until at least 1 year of age. Further research is needed to determine if these changes mediate future development of metabolic and immune conditions.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence increases yearly, and is three to four times higher in developed countries compared to developing countries. The well-known risk factors have been attributed to low physical activity, overweight, obesity, dietary consumption including excessive consumption of red processed meats, alcohol, and low dietary fiber content. There is growing evidence of the interplay between diet and gut microbiota in CRC carcinogenesis. Although there appears to be a direct causal role for gut microbes in the development of CRC in some animal models, the link between diet, gut microbes, and colonic carcinogenesis has been established largely as an association rather than as a cause-and-effect relationship. This is especially true for human studies. As essential dietary factors influence CRC risk, the role of proteins, carbohydrates, fat, and their end products are considered as part of the interplay between diet and gut microbiota. The underlying molecular mechanisms of colon carcinogenesis mediated by gut microbiota are also discussed. Human biological responses such as inflammation, oxidative stress, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage can all influence dysbiosis and consequently CRC carcinogenesis. Dysbiosis could add to CRC risk by shifting the effect of dietary components toward promoting a colonic neoplasm together with interacting with gut microbiota. It follows that dietary intervention and gut microbiota modulation may play a vital role in reducing CRC risk.",

Pharmacotherapy is the main therapeutic option for HE. It targets the pathogenesis of HE by reducing ammonia levels, improving neurotransmitter signal transduction, and modulating intestinal microbiota. Compared to healthy individuals, the intestinal microbiota of patients with liver disease is significantly different and is associated with the occurrence of HE. Moreover, intestinal microbiota is closely associated with multiple links in the pathogenesis of HE, including the theory of ammonia intoxication, bile acid circulation, GABA-ergic tone hypothesis, and neuroinflammation, which contribute to cognitive and motor disorders in patients. Restoring the homeostasis of intestinal bacteria or providing specific probiotics has significant effects on neurological disorders in HE. Therefore, this review aims at elucidating the potential microbial mechanisms and metabolic effects in the progression of HE through the gut-brain axis and its potential role as a therapeutic target in HE.",

Because several inflammatory disorders appear to affect this population, a further understanding of host genomic background variants, in conjunction with colonic mucosa dysbiosis, is necessary to determine IBS physiopathology and the effects of environmental pressures. Using a simple polygenic model, host single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the taxonomic compositions of microbiota were compared between IBS patients and healthy subjects. As proof of concept, five IBS-Rome III patients and five healthy controls (HCs) were systematically studied. The human and bacterial intestinal metagenome of each subject was taxonomically annotated and screened for previously annotated IBS, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease-associated SNPs or taxon abundance. Dietary data and fecal markers were collected and associated with the intestinal microbiome. However, more than 1,000 variants were found, and at least 76 SNPs differentiated IBS patients from HCs, as did associations with 4 phyla and 10 bacterial genera. In this study, we found elements supporting a polygenic background, with frequent variants, among the Mestizo population, and the colonic mucosal enrichment of <i>Bacteroides, Alteromonas, Neisseria, Streptococcus</i>, and <i>Microbacterium</i>, may serve as a hallmark for IBS.",

Therefore, we aimed to determine whether a distinct serum microbiome is observed in asthmatics by metagenomic analysis of serum extracellular vesicles (EVs). We obtained serum from 190 adults with asthma and 260 healthy controls, from which EVs were isolated and analyzed. The bacterial composition of asthmatics was significantly different from that of healthy controls. Chao 1 index was significantly higher in the asthma group, while Shannon and Simpson indices were higher in the control group. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes was more abundant in asthmatics, while Actinobacter, Verrucomicrobia, and Cyanobacteria were more abundant in healthy controls. At the genus level, 24 bacterial genera showed differences in relative abundance between asthmatics and controls, with linear discriminant analysis scores greater than 3. Further, in a diagnostic model based on these differences, a high predictive value with a sensitivity of 0.92 and a specificity of 0.93 was observed. In conclusion, we demonstrated distinct blood microbiome in asthma indicating the role of microbiome as a potential diagnostic marker of asthma.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have investigated the anti-obesity effects of probiotics in animal models and humans. However, few studies have focused on the mechanisms of obesity-inducing probiotics. In a previous study, we demonstrated that specific bacterial strains isolated from kefir, <i>Lactobacillus kefirnofaciens</i> M1 and <i>Lactobacillus mali</i> APS1, possess obesity and anti-obesity effects, respectively, in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Thus, in the present study, we systematically investigated whether APS1 and M1 affect energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism in HFD-induced obese mice and how this might be achieved. We observed that the M1/APS1 intervention influenced fat accumulation by regulating adipogenesis and inflammation-related marker expression both <i>in vitro</i> and in a HFD induced C57BL/6J mice model. We also observed putative links between key taxa and possible metabolic processes of the gut microbiota. Notably, families <i>Christensenellaceae</i> and <i>S24_7</i> were negatively correlated with body weight gain through increase in the essential esterized carnitine for energy expenditure. These results suggest the importance of specific probiotic interventions affecting leanness and obesity of subjects under a HFD, which are operated by modulating the tripartite relationship among the host, microbiota, and metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Perturbations in early life gut microbiota can have long-term impacts on host health. In this study, we investigated antimicrobial-induced temporal changes in diversity, stability, and compositions of gut microbiota in neonatal veal calves, with the objective of identifying microbial markers that predict diarrhea. A total of 220 samples from 63 calves in first 8 weeks of life were used in this study. The results suggest that increase in diversity and stability of gut microbiota over time was a feature of \"healthy\" (non-diarrheic) calves during early life. Therapeutic antimicrobials delayed the temporal development of diversity and taxa-function robustness (a measure of microbial stability). In addition, predicted genes associated with beta lactam and cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance were more abundant in gut microbiota of calves treated with therapeutic antimicrobials. Random forest machine learning algorithm revealed that Trueperella, Streptococcus, Dorea, uncultured Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcus 2, and Erysipelatoclostridium may be key microbial markers that can differentiate \"healthy\" and \"unhealthy\" (diarrheic) gut microbiota, as they predicted early life diarrhea with an accuracy of 84.3%. Our findings suggest that diarrhea in veal calves may be predicted by the shift in early life gut microbiota, which may provide an opportunity for early intervention (e.g., prebiotics or probiotics) to improve calf health with reduced usage of antimicrobials.",

    "abstract": "A wealth of evidence has revealed the critical role of the gut microbiota in health and disease. Many chronic diseases have been associated with gut microbiota imbalance in its composition, diversity and functional capacity. Several types of interventions have been shown to correct microbiota imbalance and restore the beneficial metabolic outcomes of a normal microbiota. Among them, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an emergent, promising technology employed to improve clinical outcomes of various pathological conditions through modifications in the gut microbiota composition. FMT has been used successfully as a treatment option in recurrent <i>Clostridium difficile infection</i>, a condition characterized by severe gut microbiota dysbiosis. However, the potential usage of FMT in other microbiota-associated conditions different from <i>C. difficile</i> such as metabolic syndrome or obesity that are also marked by gut dysbiosis is still under investigation. Furthermore, the contribution of the gut microbiota as a cause or consequence in metabolic disease is still largely debated. This review provides critical information on the methodological approaches of FMT and its technological innovation in clinical applications. This review sheds light on the current findings and gaps in our understanding of how FMT can be used as a future biotherapeutic to restore microbial homeostasis in amelioration of obesity and diabetes.",

Due to the differences in co-evolution and co-adaptation, a large fraction of the gut microbiome is host-specific. In this study, we evaluated the effect of close human-animal interaction to the faecal metagenome and metabonome of swine, farmer and human control. Three distinct clusters were observed based on T-RFLP-derived faecal microbial composition. However, 16S-inferred faecal microbiota and metabolic profiles showed that only human control was significantly different from the swine (P < 0.05). The metabonome of farmers and human controls were highly similar. Notably, higher trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and butyrate were detected in human control and swine, respectively. The relative abundance of TMAO was positively correlated with Prevotella copri. Overall, we compared and established the relationship between the metabolites and microbiota composition of swine, farmers and human control. Based on the data obtained, we deduced that long term occupational exposure to swine and farm environment had affected the gut bacterial composition of farmers. Nonetheless, the effect was less prominent in the metabolite profiles, suggesting the gut bacteria expressed high functional plasticity and are therefore resilience to the level of community shift detected.",

In this study, the 16S rRNA sequencing was performed on fecal samples from 14 patients with WD and was compared to the results from 16 healthy individuals. The diversity and composition of the gut microbiome in the WD group were significantly lower than those in healthy individuals. The WD group presented unique richness of Gemellaceae, Pseudomonadaceae and Spirochaetaceae at family level, which were hardly detected in healthy controls. The WD group had a markedly lower abundance of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia, and a higher abundance of Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Fusobacteria than that in healthy individuals. The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio in the WD group was significantly lower than that of healthy control. In addition, the functional profile of the gut microbiome from WD patients showed a lower abundance of bacterial groups involved in the host immune and metabolism associated systems pathways such as transcription factors and ABC-type transporters, compared to healthy individuals. These results implied dysbiosis of gut microbiota may be influenced by the host metabolic disorders of WD, which may provide a new understanding of the pathogenesis and new possible therapeutic targets for WD.",

Still, the significance of human milk microbes in infant gut colonization remains an open question. Clinical studies trying to elucidate the question are confounded by the profound impact of non-microbial human milk components to intestinal microecology. Modifications in the microbiota of human milk may have biological consequences for infant colonization, metabolism, immune and neuroendocrine development, and for mammary health. However, the factors driving differences in the composition of the human milk microbiome remain poorly known. In addition to colostrum and milk, breast tissue in lactating and non-lactating women may also contain a microbiota, with implications in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and in some of the adverse outcomes associated with breast implants.

Herein we explored the effect of xylooligosaccharide, xylan, and whole wheat bran on the human gut bacteria and screened for potential ferulic acid esterase genes. Using <i>in vitro</i> fermentation, we analyzed the air pressure, pH-value, and short-chain fatty acid levels. We also performed 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing. A Venn diagram analysis revealed that 80% of the core operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were shared among the samples, and most of the xylooligosaccharide treatment core OTUs (319/333 OTUs) were shared with the other two treatments' core OTUs. A significant difference analysis revealed that the relative abundance of <i>Dorea</i>, <i>Bilophila</i>, and <i>Sulfurovum</i> in wheat bran treatment was higher than that in xylan and xylooligosaccharide treatments. The clusters of orthologous groups of proteins functional composition of all samples was similar to the microbiota composition of the control. Using metagenomic sequencing, we revealed seven genes containing the conserved residues, Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly, and the catalytic triad, Ser-His-Asp, which are thus potential ferulic acid esterase genes.

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. This is still an area of active research given that the role of gut microbiota on the primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) remains unclear. In this study, fecal samples of 30 untreated adult primary ITP patients and 29 healthy controls (HCs) were used to investigate the gut microbial community and metabolite profiles. Our results show that fecal bacteria such as <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus</i> are enriched, whereas bacteria such as <i>Bacteroides</i> are depleted in ITP patients. Notably, fecal metabolites such as fatty acyls and glycerophospholipids are enriched and strongly correlate with discrepant gut microbiota. Furthermore, combinations of <i>Weissella</i> and <i>Streptococcus anginosus</i>, or Cer (t18:0/16:0), Cer (d18:1/17:0), and 13-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid could provide good diagnostic markers for ITP. Moreover, a strong negative correlation was found between platelet count and altered gut microbiota such as <i>S. anginosus</i> and gut metabolites such as Cer (t18:0/16:0) in ITP. In conclusion, dysbiosis of both gut microbiota and metabolome develops in ITP patients compared to HCs. Several ITP-altered gut bacteria and metabolites can be diagnostic biomarkers for ITP, and are highly correlated with platelet count, suggesting that they may also play a role in ITP pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Polydextrose (PDX) is a branched glucose polymer, utilized as a soluble dietary fiber. Recently, PDX was found to have hypolipidemic effects and effects on the gut microbiota. To investigate these findings more closely, a non-targeted metabolomics approach, was exploited to determine metabolic alterations in blood and epididymal adipose tissue samples that were collected from C57BL/6 mice fed with a Western diet, with or without oral administration of PDX. Metabolomic analyses revealed significant differences between PDX- and control mice, which could be due to differences in diet or due to altered microbial metabolism in the gut. Some metabolites were found in both plasma and adipose tissue, such as the bile acid derivative deoxycholic acid and the microbiome-derived tryptophan metabolite indoxyl sulfate, both of which increased by PDX. Additionally, PDX increased the levels of glycine betaine and L-carnitine in plasma samples, which correlated negatively with plasma TG and positively correlated with bacterial genera enriched in PDX mice. The results demonstrated that PDX caused differential metabolite patterns in blood and adipose tissues and that one-carbon metabolism, associated with glycine betaine and L-carnitine, and bile acid and tryptophan metabolism are associated with the hypolipidemic effects observed in mice that were given PDX.",

Most of the published work is on bacterial dysbiosis with meager data on the role of the virome in irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal diseases. In the current study, we therefore aimed to investigate the viral community composition of the gut and test for potential dysbiosis linked to irritable bowel syndrome.<h4>Results</h4>A metagenomics analysis on fecal samples of 50 individuals - 30 of whom met the Rome IV criteria for IBS and 20 healthy controls- was conducted. There was a noticeable alteration in viral taxa observed in association with irritable bowel syndrome when compared to healthy individuals - where some eukaryotic viral taxa noticeably prevail over others. We observed a significant decrease in the diversity and abundance of enteric virome particularly in eukaryotic viruses of Megavirales in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings shed light on a new hypothesis that the alteration of the viral taxa contributes to the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome and related symptoms, and therefore, pave the way for developing a new diagnostic biomarker or anti-viral drugs for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.",

    "title": "Metagenomic Characterization of the Microbiome and Resistome of Retail Ground Beef Products.",
    "abstract": "Ground beef can be a reservoir for a variety of bacteria, including spoilage organisms, and pathogenic foodborne bacteria. These bacteria can exhibit antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which is a public health concern if resistance in pathogens leads to treatment failure in humans. Culture-dependent techniques are commonly used to study individual bacterial species, but these techniques are unable to describe the whole community of microbial species (microbiome) and the profile of AMR genes they carry (resistome), which is critical for getting a holistic perspective of AMR. The objective of this study was to characterize the microbiome and resistome of retail ground beef products labeled as coming from conventional or raised without antibiotics (RWA) production systems. Sixteen ground beef products were purchased from 6 retail grocery outlets in Fort Collins, CO, half of which were labeled as produced from cattle raised conventionally and half of products were from RWA production. Total DNA was extracted and isolated from each sample and subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing for microbiome characterization and target-enriched shotgun sequencing to characterize the resistome. Differences in the microbiome and resistome of RWA and conventional ground beef were analyzed using the R programming software. Our results suggest that the resistome and microbiome of retail ground beef products with RWA packaging labels do not differ from products that do not carry claims regarding antimicrobial drug exposures during cattle production. The resistome predominantly consisted of tetracycline resistance making up more than 90% of reads mapped to resistance gene accessions in our samples. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria predominated in the microbiome of all samples (69.6% and 29.0%, respectively), but Proteobacteria composed a higher proportion in ground beef from conventionally raised cattle. In addition, our results suggest that product management, such as packaging type, could exert a stronger influence on the microbiome than the resistome in consumer-ready products. Metagenomic analyses of ground beef is a promising tool to investigate community-wide shifts in retail ground beef. Importantly, however, results from metagenomic sequencing must be carefully considered in parallel with traditional methods to better characterize the risk of AMR in retail products.",

Recent studies revealed that members of the gut microbiota are able to produce GABA modulating the gut-brain axis response. Among members of the human gut microbiota, bifidobacteria are well known to establish many metabolic and physiologic interactions with the host. In this study, we performed genome analyses of more than 1,000 bifidobacterial strains publicly available revealing that Bifidobacterium adolescentis taxon might represent a model GABA producer in human gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, the in silico screening of human/animal metagenomic datasets showed an intriguing association/correlation between B. adolescentis load and mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. Interestingly, in vitro screening of 82 B. adolescentis strains allowed identifying two high GABA producers, i.e. B. adolescentis PRL2019 and B. adolescentis HD17T2H, which were employed in an in vivo trial in rats. Feeding Groningen rats with a supplementation of B. adolescentis strains, confirmed the ability of these microorganisms to stimulate the in vivo production of GABA highlighting their potential implication in gut-brain axis interactions.",

However, little is known about Oscillospira-related host information and the links between Oscillospira and other members of the gut microbial community. To study the ecology of Oscillospira and gain insights into Oscillospira-related host physiological conditions, we analyzed data from the Guangdong Gut Microbiome Project, one of the largest gut microbiota database currently. Data of 6376 participants were analyzed. We studied the prevalence and relative abundance of Oscillospira as well as the profiles of associated microbial communities. We found that Oscillospira is closely related to human health because its abundance was positively correlated with microbial diversity, high density lipoprotein, and sleep time, and was inversely correlated with diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, uric acid and Bristol stool type. Moreover, random forest analysis with five-fold cross validation showed Oscillospira could be a predictor of low BMI and constipation in the subset. Overall, in this study, we provide a basic understanding of Oscillospira-related microbiota profile and physiological parameters of the host. Our results indicate Oscillospira may play a role in aggravating constipation.",

An easily accessible and monitorable in vitro model of the gut microbiota represents a valid tool for a wider comprehension of the mechanisms by which microbes interact with the host and with each other. Herein, we present a novel and reliable system for culturing the human gut microbiota in vitro. An electrospun gelatin structure was biofabricated as scaffold for microbial growth. The efficiency of this structure in supporting microbial proliferation and biofilm formation was initially assessed for five microbes commonly inhabiting the human gut. The human fecal microbiota was then cultured on the scaffolds and microbial biofilms monitored by confocal laser and scanning electron microscopy and quantified over time. Metagenomic analyses and Real-Time qPCRs were performed to evaluate the stability of the cultured microbiota in terms of qualitative and quantitative composition. Our results reveal the three-dimensionality of the scaffold-adhered microbial consortia that maintain the bacterial biodiversity and richness found in the original sample. These findings demonstrate the validity of the developed electrospun gelatin-based system for in vitro culturing the human gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, metagenomics has become the preferred method for exploring complex microbiota such as human gut microbiota. However, several bias affecting the results of microbiota composition, such as those due to DNA extraction, have been reported. These bias have been confirmed with the development of culturomics technique. In the present study, we report the contamination of a gnotobiotic mice unit with a bacterium first detected by gram staining. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy permitted to detect a bacterium with a thick cell wall. However, in parallel, the first attempt to identify and culture this bacterium by gene amplification and metagenomics of universal 16S rRNA failed. Finally, the isolation in culture of a fastidious bacterium not detected by using universal PCR was successfully achieved by using a BCYE agar plate with CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 30 °C. We performed genome sequencing of this bacterium using a strong extraction procedure. The genomic comparison allowed us to classify this bacterium as Klenkia terrae. And finally, it was also detected in the stool and kibble that caused the contamination by using specific qPCR against this bacterium. The elucidation of this contamination provides additional evidence that DNA extraction could be a bias for the study of the microbiota. Currently, most studies that strive to analyze and compare the gut microbiota are based on metagenomics. In a gnotobiotic mice unit contaminated with the fastidious Actinobacteria Klenkia terrae, standard culture, 16S rRNA gene amplification and metagenomics failed to identify the micro-organism observed in stools by gram-staining. Only a procedure based on culturomics allowed us to identify this bacterium and to elucidate the mode of contamination of the gnotobiotic mice unit through diet.",

Deficiency of the AP-1B μ subunit (Ap1m2-/-) leads to the development of chronic colitis in mice. However, how this deficiency affects the gut microbes and its potential functions remains elusive. To gain insights into the gut microbiome of Ap1m2-/- mice having the colitis phenotype, we undertook shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis of knockout mice. We found important links to the microbial features involved in altering various physiological pathways, including carbohydrate metabolism, nutrient transportation, oxidative stress, and bacterial pathogenesis (cell motility). In addition, an increased abundance of sulfur-reducing and lactate-producing bacteria has been observed which may aggravate the colitis condition.",

Although correlations have been shown between CAD and the gut microbiota, demonstration of potential causal relationships is much more complex and challenging. In this review, we will discuss the potential direct and indirect causal roots between gut microbiota and CAD development via microbial metabolites and interaction with the immune system. Uncovering the causal relationship of gut microbiota and CAD development can lead to novel microbiome-based preventative and therapeutic interventions.

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Imbalances in the gut microbial community (dysbiosis) of vertebrates have been associated with several gastrointestinal and autoimmune diseases. However, it is unclear which taxa are associated with gut dysbiosis, and if particular gut regions or specific time periods during ontogeny are more susceptible. We also know very little of this process in non-model organisms, despite an increasing realization of the general importance of gut microbiota for health.<h4>Methods</h4>Here, we examine the changes that occur in the microbiome during dysbiosis in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract in a long-lived bird with high juvenile mortality, the ostrich (Struthio camelus). We evaluated the 16S rRNA gene composition of the ileum, cecum, and colon of 68 individuals that died of suspected enterocolitis during the first 3 months of life (diseased individuals), and of 50 healthy individuals that were euthanized as age-matched controls. We combined these data with longitudinal environmental and fecal sampling to identify potential sources of pathogenic bacteria and to unravel at which stage of development dysbiosis-associated bacteria emerge.<h4>Results</h4>Diseased individuals had drastically lower microbial alpha diversity and differed substantially in their microbial beta diversity from control individuals in all three regions of the gastrointestinal tract. The clear relationship between low diversity and disease was consistent across all ages in the ileum, but decreased with age in the cecum and colon. Several taxa were associated with mortality (Enterobacteriaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, Clostridium), while others were associated with health (Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Turicibacter, Roseburia). Environmental samples showed no evidence of dysbiosis-associated bacteria being present in either the food, water, or soil substrate. Instead, the repeated fecal sampling showed that pathobionts were already present shortly after hatching and proliferated in individuals with low microbial diversity, resulting in high mortality several weeks later.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Identifying the origins of pathobionts in neonates and the factors that subsequently influence the establishment of diverse gut microbiota may be key to understanding dysbiosis and host development.

Outdoor nature-related activities can enhance general well-being. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully delineated. Here we recruited 54 preschool children to participate in a 10-week structured nature-related \"Play&Grow\" program. Following the intervention, children were assessed for connectedness to nature and perceived stress levels using validated questionnaires. Moreover, fecal serotonin level and gut microbiota profiles were measured by ELISA and 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, respectively. Children were significantly more connected to nature after the intervention. Their gut microbiota altered, especially by modulating the abundance of Roseburia and the fecal-serotonin level. Moreover, we also observed a reduction in the overall perceived stress, particularly in the frequency of anger among these children. This study is the first to demonstrate the impact of nature-related activities on gut microbiota, fecal serotonin and psychosocial behaviour of preschool children.

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The gut-brain axis and the intestinal microbiota are emerging as key players in health and disease. Shifts in intestinal microbiota composition affect a variety of systems; however, evidence of their direct impact on cognitive functions is still lacking. We tested whether faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) from aged donor mice into young adult recipients altered the hippocampus, an area of the central nervous system (CNS) known to be affected by the ageing process and related functions.<h4>Results</h4>Young adult mice were transplanted with the microbiota from either aged or age-matched donor mice. Following transplantation, characterization of the microbiotas and metabolomics profiles along with a battery of cognitive and behavioural tests were performed. Label-free quantitative proteomics was employed to monitor protein expression in the hippocampus of the recipients. We report that FMT from aged donors led to impaired spatial learning and memory in young adult recipients, whereas anxiety, explorative behaviour and locomotor activity remained unaffected. This was paralleled by altered expression of proteins involved in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission in the hippocampus. Also, a strong reduction of bacteria associated with short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production (Lachnospiraceae, Faecalibaculum, and Ruminococcaceae) and disorders of the CNS (Prevotellaceae and Ruminococcaceae) was observed. Finally, the detrimental effect of FMT from aged donors on the CNS was confirmed by the observation that microglia cells of the hippocampus fimbria, acquired an ageing-like phenotype; on the contrary, gut permeability and levels of systemic and local (hippocampus) cytokines were not affected.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These results demonstrate that age-associated shifts of the microbiota have an impact on protein expression and key functions of the CNS. Furthermore, these results highlight the paramount importance of the gut-brain axis in ageing and provide a strong rationale to devise therapies aiming to restore a young-like microbiota to improve cognitive functions and the declining quality of life in the elderly.

The gut microbiome confers benefits to the host, including expansion of metabolic potential and the development of an immune system that can robustly protect from external and internal insults. The cooperation between gut microbiome and host is enabled in part by the formation of partitioned niches that harbor diverse bacterial phyla. Bacterial secretion systems are commonly employed to manipulate the composition of these local environments. Here, we explore the roles of the bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS), present in ~25% of gram-negative bacteria, including many symbionts, in the establishment and perturbation of bacterial commensalism, and symbiosis in host mucosal sites. This versatile apparatus drives bacterial competition, although in some cases can also interfere directly with host cells and facilitate nutrient acquisition. In addition, some bacterial pathogens cause disease when their T6SS leads to dysbiosis and subverts host immune responses in defined animal models. This review explores our knowledge of the T6SS in the context of the \"host-microbiota-pathogen\" triumvirate and examines contexts in which the importance of this secretion system may be underappreciated.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The development of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has had a major impact on the study of genetic sequences. Among problems that researchers in the field have to face, one of the most challenging is the taxonomic classification of metagenomic reads, i.e., identifying the microorganisms that are present in a sample collected directly from the environment. The analysis of environmental samples (metagenomes) are particularly important to figure out the microbial composition of different ecosystems and it is used in a wide variety of fields: for instance, metagenomic studies in agriculture can help understanding the interactions between plants and microbes, or in ecology, they can provide valuable insights into the functions of environmental communities.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we describe a new lightweight alignment-free and assembly-free framework for metagenomic classification that compares each unknown sequence in the sample to a collection of known genomes. We take advantage of the combinatorial properties of an extension of the Burrows-Wheeler transform, and we sequentially scan the required data structures, so that we can analyze unknown sequences of large collections using little internal memory. The tool LiME (Lightweight Metagenomics via eBWT) is available at https://github.com/veronicaguerrini/LiME .<h4>Conclusions</h4>In order to assess the reliability of our approach, we run several experiments on NGS data from two simulated metagenomes among those provided in benchmarking analysis and on a real metagenome from the Human Microbiome Project. The experiment results on the simulated data show that LiME is competitive with the widely used taxonomic classifiers. It achieves high levels of precision and specificity - e.g. 99.9% of the positive control reads are correctly assigned and the percentage of classified reads of the negative control is less than 0.01% - while keeping a high sensitivity. On the real metagenome, we show that LiME is able to deliver classification results comparable to that of MagicBlast. Overall, the experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method and its high accuracy even in negative control samples.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Research around the weedkiller Roundup is among the most contentious of the twenty-first century. Scientists have provided inconclusive evidence that the weedkiller causes cancer and other life-threatening diseases, while industry-paid research reports that the weedkiller has no adverse effect on humans or animals. Much of the controversial evidence on Roundup is rooted in the approach used to determine safe use of chemicals, defined by outdated toxicity tests. We apply a system biology approach to the biomedical and ecological model species Daphnia to quantify the impact of glyphosate and of its commercial formula, Roundup, on fitness, genome-wide transcription and gut microbiota, taking full advantage of clonal reproduction in Daphnia. We then apply machine learning-based statistical analysis to identify and prioritize correlations between genome-wide transcriptional and microbiota changes.<h4>Results</h4>We demonstrate that chronic exposure to ecologically relevant concentrations of glyphosate and Roundup at the approved regulatory threshold for drinking water in the US induce embryonic developmental failure, induce significant DNA damage (genotoxicity), and interfere with signaling. Furthermore, chronic exposure to the weedkiller alters the gut microbiota functionality and composition interfering with carbon and fat metabolism, as well as homeostasis. Using the \"Reactome,\" we identify conserved pathways across the Tree of Life, which are potential targets for Roundup in other species, including liver metabolism, inflammation pathways, and collagen degradation, responsible for the repair of wounds and tissue remodeling.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results show that chronic exposure to concentrations of Roundup and glyphosate at the approved regulatory threshold for drinking water causes embryonic development failure and alteration of key metabolic functions via direct effect on the host molecular processes and indirect effect on the gut microbiota. The ecological model species Daphnia occupies a central position in the food web of aquatic ecosystems, being the preferred food of small vertebrates and invertebrates as well as a grazer of algae and bacteria. The impact of the weedkiller on this keystone species has cascading effects on aquatic food webs, affecting their ability to deliver critical ecosystem services. Video Abstract.",

    "abstract": "Microbes are the most prevalent form of life yet also the least well-understood in terms of their diversity. Due to a greater appreciation of their role in modulating host physiology, microbes have come to the forefront of biological investigation of human health and disease. Despite this, capturing the heterogeneity of microbes, and that of the host responses they induce, has been challenging due to the bulk methods of nucleic acid and cellular analysis. One of the greatest recent advancements in our understanding of complex organisms has happened in the field of single-cell analysis through genomics, transcriptomics, and spatial resolution. While significantly advancing our understanding of host biology, these techniques have only recently been applied to microbial systems to shed light on their diversity as well as interactions with host cells in both commensal and pathogenic contexts. In this review, we highlight emerging technologies that are poised to provide key insights into understanding how microbe heterogeneity can be studied. We then take a detailed look into how host single-cell analysis has uncovered the impact of microbes on host heterogeneity and the effect of host biology on microorganisms. Most of these insights would have been challenging, and in some cases impossible, without the advent of single-cell analysis, suggesting the importance of the single-cell paradigm for progressing the microbiology field forward through a host-microbiome perspective and applying these insights to better understand and treat human disease.",

    "abstract": "Postpartum depressive disorder (PPD) is a unique subtype of major depressive disorder and a substantial contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality. However, the pathogenesis of PPD has still remained elusive, and it may associate with genetic and environmental factors. Gut microbiota has already been proved to be associated with depression; however, a limited number of studies have concentrated on PPD. The present study aimed to explore the potential correlations between gut microbiota and PPD. In this study, 57 participants were enrolled, in which fecal samples of 28 patients with PPD and 16 healthy controls (HCs) were collected and then analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. The results showed that diversity and composition of gut microbial communities were partly different between PPD patients and HCs. The relative abundance of <i>Firmicutes</i> phyla was lower in PPD patients. The levels of several predominant genera were significantly different between PPD patients and HCs. More importantly, the PPD patients experienced reduced levels of <i>Faecalibacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Butyricicoccus</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, as well as increased levels of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> family. In addition, a correlation was observed between levels of <i>Phascolarctobacterium, Lachnospiraceae, Faecalibacterium</i>, and <i>Tyzzerella.3</i> and the severity of depressive symptoms. Various kinds of bacteria, such as <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, were found to be associated with levels of sex hormones. This study indicated the correlation between gut microbiota and PPD, and gut microbiota-based biomarkers may be helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of PPD patients. However, further studies need to be conducted to clarify the cause-effect relationship between PPD patients and gut microbiota and to highlight the suitability of gut microbiome as a biomarker.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiome has a great deal of interpersonal variation due to both endogenous and exogenous factors, like household pet exposure. To examine the relationship between having a pet in the home and the composition and diversity of the adult gut microbiome, we conducted a case-control study nested in a larger, statewide study, the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin. Stool samples were collected from 332 participants from unique households and analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq. One hundred and seventy-eight participants had some type of pet in the home with dogs and cats being the most prevalent. We observed no difference in alpha and beta diversity between those with and without pets, though seven OTUs were significantly more abundant in those without pets compared to those with pets, and four were significantly more abundant in those with pets. When stratifying by age, seven of these remained significant. These results suggest that pet ownership is associated with differences in the human gut microbiota. Further research is needed to better characterize the effect of pet ownership on the human gut microbiome.",

    "title": "Metagenomic Insights Into the Mechanisms for Biodegradation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the Oil Supply Chain.",
    "abstract": "Petroleum is a very complex and diverse organic mixture. Its composition depends on reservoir location and <i>in situ</i> conditions and changes once crude oil is spilled into the environment, making the characteristics associated with every spill unique. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are common components of the crude oil and constitute a group of persistent organic pollutants. Due to their highly hydrophobic, and their low solubility tend to accumulate in soil and sediment. The process by which oil is sourced and made available for use is referred to as the oil supply chain and involves three parts: (1) upstream, (2) midstream and (3) downstream activities. As consequence from oil supply chain activities, crude oils are subjected to biodeterioration, acidification and souring, and oil spills are frequently reported affecting not only the environment, but also the economy and human resources. Different bioremediation techniques based on microbial metabolism, such as natural attenuation, bioaugmentation, biostimulation are promising approaches to minimize the environmental impact of oil spills. The rate and efficiency of this process depend on multiple factors, like pH, oxygen content, temperature, availability and concentration of the pollutants and diversity and structure of the microbial community present in the affected (contaminated) area. Emerging approaches, such as (meta-)taxonomics and (meta-)genomics bring new insights into the molecular mechanisms of PAH microbial degradation at both single species and community levels in oil reservoirs and groundwater/seawater spills. We have scrutinized the microbiological aspects of biodegradation of PAHs naturally occurring in oil upstream activities (exploration and production), and crude oil and/or by-products spills in midstream (transport and storage) and downstream (refining and distribution) activities. This work addresses PAH biodegradation in different stages of oil supply chain affecting diverse environments (groundwater, seawater, oil reservoir) focusing on genes and pathways as well as key players involved in this process. In depth understanding of the biodegradation process will provide/improve knowledge for optimizing and monitoring bioremediation in oil spills cases and/or to impair the degradation in reservoirs avoiding deterioration of crude oil quality.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The study aimed to identify the effects of modeling procedures on bacterial communities and to investigate whether different modeling procedures lead to consistent patterns of gut microbiome compositions.<h4>Methods</h4>Two irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) rat models maternal separation (MS) alone and multiple-early-adversity modeling (MAM) were established and the gut microbiome were analyzed using 16S-rRNA-based high-throughput sequencing methods.<h4>Results</h4>Rats from both models exhibited visceral hypersensitivity and the two model groups exhibited differences in the extent of visceral sensitivity and fecal water content. The microbial community structure of the two models exhibited significant differences compared to the controls, while the two model groups also exhibited significant differences between them. Furthermore, microbial community functional predictions suggested that the two models exhibited different abundances of metabolisms and pathways. Several common and distinct characteristic differences were also observed between the two model groups. <i>Alloprevotella</i> were more abundant in both model groups, while <i>Butyricicoccus</i>, <i>Turicibacter</i>, <i>Ruminococcus</i>, and <i>Clostridium_sensu_stricto</i> along with the family it belongs to were less abundant relative to controls. In addition, the abundance of <i>Clostridium_IV</i>, <i>Corynebacterium</i>, <i>Rothia</i>, <i>Elusimicrobium</i>, <i>Romboutsia</i>, <i>Allobaculum</i>, <i>Parasutterella</i>, and their related taxa were specifically associated with MS group, whereas <i>Butyricimonas</i> and <i>Vampirovibrio</i> along with its related taxa were specifically associated with MAM group. Among those, <i>Butyricimonas</i>, <i>Butyricicoccus</i> and <i>Corynebacterium</i> were found to partially mediate early adversity exposure-induced visceral hypersensitivity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results highlight the importance in evaluating gut microbiota characteristics in IBS research while also systematically considering potential modeling procedural differences. The microbial compositional/functional differences identified in this study were suggestive to further investigation of mechanisms of early adversity induced IBS.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The vertebrate clade diverged into Chondrichthyes (sharks, rays, and chimeras) and Osteichthyes fishes (bony fishes) approximately 420 mya, with each group accumulating vast anatomical and physiological differences, including skin properties. The skin of Chondrichthyes fishes is covered in dermal denticles, whereas Osteichthyes fishes are covered in scales and are mucous rich. The divergence time among these two fish groups is hypothesized to result in predictable variation among symbionts. Here, using shotgun metagenomics, we test if patterns of diversity in the skin surface microbiome across the two fish clades match predictions made by phylosymbiosis theory. We hypothesize (1) the skin microbiome will be host and clade-specific, (2) evolutionary difference in elasmobranch and teleost will correspond with a concomitant increase in host-microbiome dissimilarity, and (3) the skin structure of the two groups will affect the taxonomic and functional composition of the microbiomes.<h4>Results</h4>We show that the taxonomic and functional composition of the microbiomes is host-specific. Teleost fish had lower average microbiome within clade similarity compared to among clade comparison, but their composition is not different among clade in a null based model. Elasmobranch's average similarity within clade was not different than across clade and not different in a null based model of comparison. In the comparison of host distance with microbiome distance, we found that the taxonomic composition of the microbiome was related to host distance for the elasmobranchs, but not the teleost fishes. In comparison, the gene function composition was not related to the host-organism distance for elasmobranchs but was negatively correlated with host distance for teleost fishes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results show the patterns of phylosymbiosis are not consistent across both fish clades, with the elasmobranchs showing phylosymbiosis, while the teleost fish are not. The discrepancy may be linked to alternative processes underpinning microbiome assemblage, including possible historical host-microbiome evolution of the elasmobranchs and convergent evolution in the teleost which filter specific microbial groups. Our comparison of the microbiomes among fishes represents an investigation into the microbial relationships of the oldest divergence of extant vertebrate hosts and reveals that microbial relationships are not consistent across evolutionary timescales.

    "abstract": "High-fat diet (HFD) leads to enhancement in various parameters of mice like weight, fasting glucose levels, adipose tissue, and also the liver weight in male C57 BL/6 J mice. Additionally, high-fat diet causes severe liver damage with significant increase in the level of aspartate amino transferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT). The variations in microbiota induced by different diet were analyzed by Illumina MiSeq platform with sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, and QIIME pipeline was used. The population of Proteobacteria was found to be higher in HFD cecum sample as compared to other treatments. Microbiota analysis suggests that phylum Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were found to be higher in high-fat diet groups as compared to mice fed with normal diet (ND). At the genus level, <i>Bacteroides</i> showed higher population in HFD diet. Bacterial strains belonging to <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> like <i>Escherichia, Klebsiella</i>, and <i>Shigella</i> were also dominant in HFD treatments. Furthermore, we explored the effects of ethanol production <i>in vitro</i> with supplementation of dietary fibers following inoculation of ND and HFD microbiotas. HFD microbiota of cecum and feces showed high level (<i>P</i> < 0.05) of ethanol production with 2% fructooligosaccharide (FOS) as compared to 2% galactomannan. Microbial fermentation also generated short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. High levels (<i>P</i> < 0.05) of propionate were found after fermentation of FOS with HFD cecum and feces microbiota. The present study highlights the HFD-induced population of phylum Proteobacteria and genus <i>Bacteroides</i> for ethanol production using FOS as a dietary supplement, and these findings may imply on the harmful effect of HFD even at the microbiota level.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Recently, we reported that some dairy cows could produce high amounts of milk with high amounts of protein (defined as milk protein yield [MPY]) when a population was raised under the same nutritional and management condition, a potential new trait that can be used to increase high-quality milk production. It is unknown to what extent the rumen microbiome and its metabolites, as well as the host metabolism, contribute to MPY. Here, analysis of rumen metagenomics and metabolomics, together with serum metabolomics was performed to identify potential regulatory mechanisms of MPY at both the rumen microbiome and host levels.<h4>Results</h4>Metagenomics analysis revealed that several Prevotella species were significantly more abundant in the rumen of high-MPY cows, contributing to improved functions related to branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. In addition, the rumen microbiome of high-MPY cows had lower relative abundances of organisms with methanogen and methanogenesis functions, suggesting that these cows may produce less methane. Metabolomics analysis revealed that the relative concentrations of rumen microbial metabolites (mainly amino acids, carboxylic acids, and fatty acids) and the absolute concentrations of volatile fatty acids were higher in the high-MPY cows. By associating the rumen microbiome with the rumen metabolome, we found that specific microbial taxa (mainly Prevotella species) were positively correlated with ruminal microbial metabolites, including the amino acids and carbohydrates involved in glutathione, phenylalanine, starch, sucrose, and galactose metabolism. To detect the interactions between the rumen microbiome and host metabolism, we associated the rumen microbiome with the host serum metabolome and found that Prevotella species may affect the host's metabolism of amino acids (including glycine, serine, threonine, alanine, aspartate, glutamate, cysteine, and methionine). Further analysis using the linear mixed effect model estimated contributions to the variation in MPY based on different omics and revealed that the rumen microbial composition, functions, and metabolites, and the serum metabolites contributed 17.81, 21.56, 29.76, and 26.78%, respectively, to the host MPY.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings provide a fundamental understanding of how the microbiome-dependent and host-dependent mechanisms contribute to varied individualized performance in the milk production quality of dairy cows under the same management condition. This fundamental information is vital for the development of potential manipulation strategies to improve milk quality and production through precision feeding. Video Abstract.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that features of the gut microbiota correlate with ischemic stroke. However, the specific characteristics of the gut microbiota in patients suffering different types of ischemic stroke, or recovering from such strokes, have rarely been studied, and potential microbiotic predictors of different types of stroke have seldom been analyzed. We subjected fecal specimens from patients with lacunar or non-lacunar acute ischemic infarctions, and those recovering from such strokes, to bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and compared the results to those of healthy volunteers. We identified microbial markers of different types of ischemic stroke and verified that these were of diagnostic utility. Patients with two types of ischemic stroke, and those recovering from ischemic stroke, exhibited significant shifts in microbiotic diversities compared to healthy subjects. Cluster of Orthologous Groups of Proteins (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses revealed reduced metabolic and transport-related pathway activities in ischemic stroke patients. We performed fivefold cross-validation using a Random Forest model to identify two optimal bacterial species (operational taxonomic units; OTUs) serving as markers of lacunar infarction; these were <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> (OTU_45) and <i>Bacteroides</i> (OTU_4), and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs under the ROCs) were 0.881 and 0.872 respectively. In terms of non-lacunar acute ischemic infarction detection, the two optimal species were <i>Bilophila</i> (OTU_330) and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> (OTU_338); the AUCs under the ROCs were 0.985 and 0.929 respectively. In post-ischemic stroke patients, the three optimal species were <i>Pseudomonas</i> (OTU_35), <i>Sphingomonadaceae</i> (OTU_303), and <i>Akkermansia</i> (OTU_9); the AUCs under the ROCs were 1, 0.897, and 0.846 respectively. Notably, the gut microbial markers were of considerable value for utility when diagnosing lacunar infarction, non-lacunar acute ischemic infarction, and post-ischemic stroke. This study is the first to characterize the gut microbiotic profiles of patients with lacunar or non-lacunar, acute ischemic strokes, and those recovering from stroke, and to identify microbiotic predictors of such strokes.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Neuropathic pain is an abnormally increased sensitivity to pain, especially from mechanical or thermal stimuli. To date, the current pharmacological treatments for neuropathic pain are still unsatisfactory. The gut microbiota reportedly plays important roles in inducing neuropathic pain, so probiotics have also been used to treat it. However, the underlying questions around the interactions in and stability of the gut microbiota in a spared nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain model and the key microbes (i.e., the microbes that play critical roles) involved have not been answered. We collected 66 fecal samples over 2 weeks (three mice and 11 time points in spared nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain and Sham groups). The 16S rRNA gene was polymerase chain reaction amplified, sequenced on a MiSeq platform, and analyzed using a MOTHUR- UPARSE pipeline.<h4>Results</h4>Here we show that spared nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain alters gut microbial diversity in mice. We successfully constructed reliable microbial interaction networks using the Metagenomic Microbial Interaction Simulator (MetaMIS) and analyzed these networks based on 177,147 simulations. Interestingly, at a higher resolution, our results showed that spared nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain altered both the stability of the microbial community and the key microbes in a gut micro-ecosystem. Oscillospira, which was classified as a low-abundance and core microbe, was identified as the key microbe in the Sham group, whereas Staphylococcus, classified as a rare and non-core microbe, was identified as the key microbe in the spared nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In summary, our results provide novel experimental evidence that spared nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain reshapes gut microbial diversity, and alters the stability and key microbes in the gut.",

    "abstract": "Microbiota-host-diet interactions contribute to the development of metabolic diseases. Imidazole propionate is a novel microbially produced metabolite from histidine, which impairs glucose metabolism. Here, we show that subjects with prediabetes and diabetes in the MetaCardis cohort from three European countries have elevated serum imidazole propionate levels. Furthermore, imidazole propionate levels were increased in subjects with low bacterial gene richness and Bacteroides 2 enterotype, which have previously been associated with obesity. The Bacteroides 2 enterotype was also associated with increased abundance of the genes involved in imidazole propionate biosynthesis from dietary histidine. Since patients and controls did not differ in their histidine dietary intake, the elevated levels of imidazole propionate in type 2 diabetes likely reflects altered microbial metabolism of histidine, rather than histidine intake per se. Thus the microbiota may contribute to type 2 diabetes by generating imidazole propionate that can modulate host inflammation and metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Ancient parchments record an immense part of our cultural heritage, having been used as the main written support material for centuries. Parchment easily undergoes biodeterioration, whose main signs are the so-called <i>purple spots</i>, which often lead to detachment of the superficial written layer. Up to recent years, several studies have been analyzing damaged parchments from different world's archives, trying to trace back the culprit of the purple spots. However, standard cultivation and early molecular techniques have been demonstrated to be unsuccessful, leading the parchment damage issue remaining unsolved for many years. Nowadays, some studies have explored the parchment biodeterioration dynamics by adopting a multidisciplinary approach combining standard microbiological methods with high-throughput molecular, chemical and physical techniques. This approach allowed an unprecedented level of knowledge on the complex dynamics of parchment biodeterioration. This mini review discusses the application of the combination of basic and high-throughput techniques to study historical parchments, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. In particular, it focuses on how metagenomics has been paramount for the unequivocal identification of the microbial main actors of parchment biodeterioration and their dynamics, but also on how metagenomics may suffer the distortion inflict by the historical perspective on the analysis of ancient specimens. As a whole, this mini review aims to describe the <i>scenario</i> of information on parchment biodeterioration obtained so far by using the integration of metagenomic with recent chemical (Raman spectroscopy) and physical (Light Transmission Analysis) approaches, which might have key implications in the preservation of many ancient documents.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Antibiotic treatment has a well-established detrimental effect on the gut bacterial composition, but effects on the fungal community are less clear. Bacteria in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract may limit fungal colonization and invasion. Antibiotic drugs targeting bacteria are therefore seen as an important risk factor for fungal infections and induced allergies. However, antibiotic effects on gut bacterial-fungal interactions, including disruption and resilience of fungal community compositions, were not investigated in humans. We analysed stool samples collected from 14 healthy human participants over 3 months following a 6-day antibiotic administration. We integrated data from shotgun metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and fungal ITS2 sequencing.<h4>Results</h4>While the bacterial community recovered mostly over 3 months post treatment, the fungal community was shifted from mutualism at baseline to competition. Half of the bacterial-fungal interactions present before drug intervention had disappeared 3 months later. During treatment, fungal abundances were associated with the expression of bacterial genes with functions for cell growth and repair. By extending the metagenomic species approach, we revealed bacterial strains inhibiting the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans. We demonstrated in vitro how C. albicans pathogenicity and host cell damage might be controlled naturally in the human gut by bacterial metabolites such as propionate or 5-dodecenoate.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrated that antibacterial drugs have long-term influence on the human gut mycobiome. While bacterial communities recovered mostly 30-days post antibacterial treatment, the fungal community was shifted from mutualism towards competition. Video abstract.",

    "abstract": "Ginger, a widely used functional food and food additive, little is known about the effect of ginger juice, which is rich in many healthful agents, on healthy humans or on its relationship with gut microbiota composition variation. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in the gut microbial communities that occur following the supplementation of fresh ginger-derived juice in healthy adults and its potential associations with function. A crossover intervention study in which 123 healthy subjects (63 men and 60 women) consumed fresh ginger juice from <i>Zingiber officinale Rosc</i>. or sterile 0.9% sodium chloride was conducted. 16S rRNA sequencing analyses were applied to characterize gut microbiota variation. We found that ginger juice intervention increased the species number of intestinal flora. A decreased relative abundance of the Prevotella-to-Bacteroides ratio and pro-inflammatory <i>Ruminococcus_1</i> and <i>Ruminococcus_2</i> while a tendency toward an increased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, Proteobacteria and anti-inflammatory <i>Faecalibacterium</i> were found. When we did not consider gender, we found differences in bacterial diversity both in community evenness and in richness caused by ginger intervention. In fact, there were different changes in bacterial α-diversity induced by the ginger juice in men and women. We identified 19 bacterial genera with significant differences between the control group (women) and ginger group (women) and 15 significant differences between the control group (men) and ginger group (men) at the genus level. Our results showed that short-term intake of ginger juice had substantial effects on the composition and function of gut microbiota in healthy people. Moreover, our findings underscored the importance of analyzing both male and female individuals to investigate the effects of ginger on gut microbiota. Additional studies are necessary to confirm these findings.",

There are still no vaccines or specific antiviral therapies against RSV, mainly due to the inadequate understanding of RSV pathogenesis. Recent data suggest a role for gut microbiota community structure in determining RSV disease severity. Our objective was to determine the gut microbial profile associated with severe RSV patients, which could be used to help identify at-risk patients and develop therapeutically protective microbial assemblages that may stimulate immuno-protection.<h4>Results</h4>We enrolled 95 infants from Le Bonheur during the 2014 to 2016 RSV season. Of these, 37 were well-babies and 58 were hospitalized with RSV. Of the RSV infected babies, 53 remained in the pediatric ward (moderate) and 5 were moved to the pediatric intensive care unit at a later date (severe). Stool samples were collected within 72 h of admission; and the composition of gut microbiota was evaluated via 16S sequencing of fecal DNA. There was a significant enrichment in S24_7, Clostridiales, Odoribacteraceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Actinomyces in RSV (moderate and severe) vs. controls. Patients with severe RSV disease had slightly lower alpha diversity (richness and evenness of the bacterial community) of the gut microbiota compared to patients with moderate RSV and healthy controls. Beta diversity (overall microbial composition) was significantly different between all RSV patients (moderate and severe) compared to controls and had significant microbial composition separating all three groups (control, moderate RSV, and severe RSV).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Collectively, these data demonstrate that a unique gut microbial profile is associated with RSV disease and with severe RSV disease with admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. More mechanistic experiments are needed to determine whether the differences observed in gut microbiota are the cause or consequences of severe RSV disease.",

    "abstract": "Radiation enteritis (RE) is a common complication in cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. Although studies have shown the changes of this disease at clinical, pathological and other levels, the dynamic characteristics of local microbiome and metabolomics are hitherto unknown. We aimed to examine the multi-omics features of the gut microecosystem, determining the functional correlation between microbiome and lipid metabolites during RE activity. By delivering single high-dose irradiation, a RE mouse model was established. High-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing and global lipidomics analysis were performed to examine microbial and lipidomic profile changes in the gut microecosystem. Spearman correlation analysis was used to determine the functional correlation between bacteria and metabolites. Clinical samples were collected to validate the above observations. During RE activity, the intestinal inflammation of the mice was confirmed by typical signs, symptoms, imaging findings and pathological evidences. 16S datasets revealed that localized irradiation dramatically altered the gut microbial composition, resulting in a decrease ratio of <i>Bacteroidetes</i> to <i>Firmicutes</i>. Lipidomics analysis indicated the remarkable lipidomic profile changes in enteric epithelial barrier, determining that glycerophospholipids metabolism was correlated to RE progression with the highest relevance. Spearman correlation analysis identified that five bacteria-metabolite pairs showed the most significant functional correlation in RE, including <i>Alistipes</i>-PC(36:0e), <i>Bacteroides</i>-DG(18:0/20:4), <i>Dubosiella</i>-PC(35:2), <i>Eggerthellaceae</i>-PC(35:6), and <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>-TG(18:2/18:2/20:4). These observations were partly confirmed in human specimens.

We investigated changes in the extracellular phageome and discussed its role in T2D pathogenesis. We used a sequencing-based approach to identify bacteriophage after isolation of VLPs (virus like particles) from fecal samples. We identified 330 species of phages according to the predicted host bacteria from T2D patients (N=17) and nondiabetic controls (N=29). The phageome characteristics were highly diverse among individuals. In the T2D group, the intestinal phage population was altered, and the abundance of phages specific to <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> hosts increased markedly. Meanwhile, the abundance of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> in the gut was significantly increased, and systemic LPS content elevation was observed in the T2D group. Additionally, a consortia of eight phages was found to distinguish T2D patients from nondiabetic controls with good performance (AUC>0.99).",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Termites are among the most successful insect lineages on the globe and are responsible for providing numerous ecosystem services. They mainly feed on wood and other plant material at different stages of humification. Lignocellulose is often a principal component of such plant diet, and termites largely rely on their symbiotic microbiota and associated enzymes to decompose their food efficiently. While lower termites and their gut flagellates were given larger scientific attention in the past, the gut lignocellulolytic bacteria of higher termites remain less explored. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the structure and function of gut prokaryotic microbiomes from 11 higher termite genera representative of Syntermitinae, Apicotermitinae, Termitidae and Nasutitermitinae subfamilies, broadly grouped into plant fibre- and soil-feeding termite categories.<h4>Results</h4>Despite the different compositional structures of the studied termite gut microbiomes, reflecting well the diet and host lineage, we observed a surprisingly high functional congruency between gut metatranscriptomes from both feeding groups. The abundance of transcripts encoding for carbohydrate active enzymes as well as expression and diversity profiles of assigned glycoside hydrolase families were also similar between plant fibre- and soil-feeding termites. Yet, dietary imprints highlighted subtle metabolic differences specific to each feeding category. Roughly, 0.18% of de novo re-constructed gene transcripts were shared between the different termite gut microbiomes, making each termite gut a unique reservoir of genes encoding for potentially industrially applicable enzymes, e.g. relevant to biomass degradation. Taken together, we demonstrated the functional equivalence in microbial populations across different termite hosts.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results provide valuable insight into the bacterial component of the termite gut system and significantly expand the inventory of termite prokaryotic genes participating in the deconstruction of plant biomass.

    "abstract": "Biologists with bioinformatic skills will be better prepared for the job market, but relatively few biology programs require bioinformatics courses. Inclusion in the curriculum may be hindered by several barriers, including lack of faculty expertise, student resistance to computational work, and few examples in the pedagogical literature. An 8-week wet-lab and <i>in silico</i> research experience for undergraduates was implemented. Students performed DNA purification and metagenomics analysis to compare the diversity and abundance of microbes in two samples. Students sampled snow from sites in northern Minnesota and purified genomic DNA from the microbes, followed by metagenomic analysis. Students used an existing metagenomic dataset to practice analysis skills, including comparing the use of Excel versus R for analysis and visualization of a large dataset. Upon receipt of the snow data, students applied their recently acquired skills to their new dataset and reported their results via a poster. Several outcomes were achieved as a result of this module. First, YouTube videos demonstrating hands-on metagenomics and R techniques were used as professional development for faculty, leading to broadened research capabilities and comfort with bioinformatics. Second, students were introduced to computational skills in a manner that was intentional, with time for both introduction <i>and</i> reinforcement of skills. Finally, the module was effectively included in a biology curriculum because it could function as either a stand-alone course or a module within another course such as microbiology. This module, developed with Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience guidelines in mind, introduces students and faculty to bioinformatics in biology research.",

However, this approach is challenging in samples, such as milk, where a low microbial abundance, combined with high levels of host DNA, result in inefficient and uneconomical sequencing. Here we evaluate approaches to deplete host DNA or enrich microbial DNA prior to sequencing using three commercially available kits. We compared the percentage of microbial reads obtained from each kit after shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Using bovine and human milk samples, we determined that host depletion with the MolYsis complete5 kit significantly improved microbial sequencing depth compared to other approaches tested. Importantly, no biases were introduced. Additionally, the increased microbial sequencing depth allowed for further characterization of the microbiome through the generation of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Furthermore, with the use of a mock community, we compared three common classifiers and determined that Kraken2 was the optimal classifier for these samples. This evaluation shows that microbiome analysis can be performed on both bovine and human milk samples at a much greater resolution without the need for more expensive deep-sequencing approaches.",

Gut bacteria became detectable using molecular methods by 16 h after birth. Detailed analysis of the three most common species, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides vulgatus, did not suggest a genomic signature for neonatal gut colonization. The appearance of bacteria was associated with reduced abundance of approximately 50 human proteins, decreased levels of free amino acids and an increase in products of bacterial fermentation, including acetate and succinate. Using flux balance modelling and in vitro experiments, we provide evidence that fermentation of amino acids provides a mechanism for the initial growth of E. coli, the most common early colonizer, under anaerobic conditions.

We have developed a protocol to extract nucleic acids from viruses at the mucosal-luminal interface of the proximal and distal colon. Colonic viromes from pediatric patients with Crohn's disease demonstrated high interpatient diversity and low but significant intrapatient variation between sites. Whole metagenomics was also performed to explore virome-bacteriome interactions and to compare the viral communities observed in virome and whole metagenomic sequencing.

    "abstract": "Temporal development of the human gut microbiome from infancy to childhood is driven by a variety of factors. We surveyed the fecal microbiome of 729 Chinese children aged 0-36 months, aiming to identify the age-specific patterns of microbiota succession, and evaluate the impact of birth mode, gender, geographical location, and gastrointestinal tract symptoms on the shaping of the gut microbiome. We demonstrated that phylogenetic diversity of the gut microbiome increased gradually over time, which was accompanied by an increase in <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and a reduction in <i>Proteobacteria</i> species. Analysis of community-wide phenotypes revealed a succession from aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria to facultative anaerobes, and from Gram-negative to Gram-positive species during gut microbiota development in early childhood. The metabolic functions of the gut microbiome shifted tremendously alongside early physiological development, including an increase in alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, and a reduction in glutathione, fatty acid, and tyrosine metabolism. During the first year of life, the <i>Bacteroidetes</i> phylum was less abundant in children born by casarean section compared with those delivered vaginally. The <i>Enterococcaceae</i> family, a group of facultative anaerobic microorganisms with pathogenic potential, was predominant in preterm infants. No measurable effect of maternal antibiotic exposure on gut microbiota development was found in the first 3 years of life. The relative abundances of <i>Coriobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Streptococcaceae</i> families, and <i>Megasphaera</i> genus were found to be higher in girls than in boys. Among the three first-tier Chinese cities, children born and fed in Beijing had a higher abundance of <i>Enterococcaceae</i> and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> families, and Shenzhen children had a higher abundance of <i>Fusobacteriaceae</i>. The families <i>Alcaligenaceae</i>, <i>Bacteroidaceae</i>, and <i>Porphyromonadaceae</i> were more abundant in children with constipation, whereas the relative abundance of the <i>Clostridium</i> genus was higher in those with diarrhea.",

    "abstract": "Massive metagenomic sequencing combined with gene prediction methods were previously used to compile the gene catalogue of the ocean and host-associated microbes. Global expeditions conducted over the past 15 years have sampled the ocean to build a catalogue of genes from pelagic microbes. Here we undertook a large sequencing effort of a perturbed Red Sea plankton community to uncover that the rate of gene discovery increases continuously with sequencing effort, with no indication that the retrieved 2.83 million non-redundant (complete) genes predicted from the experiment represented a nearly complete inventory of the genes present in the sampled community (i.e., no evidence of saturation). The underlying reason is the Pareto-like distribution of the abundance of genes in the plankton community, resulting in a very long tail of millions of genes present at remarkably low abundances, which can only be retrieved through massive sequencing. Microbial metagenomic projects retrieve a variable number of unique genes per Tera base-pair (Tbp), with a median value of 14.7 million unique genes per Tbp sequenced across projects. The increase in the rate of gene discovery in microbial metagenomes with sequencing effort implies that there is ample room for new gene discovery in further ocean and holobiont sequencing studies.",

Although many functions of the microbiota are still unclear, there is compelling experimental evidence showing that the intestinal microbiota is able to modulate carcinogenesis and the response to anticancer therapies, both in the intestinal tract and other body sites. Among the wide variety of gut-colonizing microorganisms, various species belonging to the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genus are believed to elicit beneficial effects on human physiology and on the host-immune system. Recent findings, based on preclinical mouse models and on human clinical trials, have demonstrated the impact of gut commensals including bifidobacteria on the efficacy of tumor-targeting immunotherapy. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure, bifidobacteria and other microorganisms have become a promising aid to immunotherapeutic procedures that are currently applied to treat cancer.

    "abstract": "Involvement of the microbiome in many different scalp conditions has been investigated over the years. Studies on the role of the scalp microbiome in specific diseases, such as those involving hair growth alterations like non-cicatricial [androgenetic alopecia (AGA), alopecia areata (AA)] and cicatricial alopecia lichen planopilaris, are of major importance. In the present work, we highlighted the differences in microbial populations inhabiting the scalp of AA subjects and a healthy sample cohort by using an integrated approach relying on metagenomic targeted 16S sequencing analysis, urine metabolomics, and human marker gene expression. Significant differences in genera abundances (<i>p</i> < 0.05) were found in the hypodermis and especially the dermis layer. Based on 16S sequencing data, we explored the differences in predicted KEGG pathways and identified some significant differences in predicted pathways related to the AA pathologic condition such as flagellar, assembly, bacterial chemotaxis, mineral absorption, ABC transporters, cellular antigens, glycosaminoglycan degradation, lysosome, sphingolipid metabolism, cell division, protein digestion and absorption, and energy metabolism. All predicted pathways were significantly enhanced in AA samples compared to expression in healthy samples, with the exceptions of mineral absorption, and ABC transporters. We also determined the expression of <i>TNF-</i>α, <i>FAS, KCNA3, NOD-2</i>, and <i>SOD-2</i> genes and explored the relationships between human gene expression levels and microbiome composition by Pearson's correlation analysis; here, significant correlations both positive (SOD vs. <i>Staphylococcus, Candidatus Aquiluna</i>) and negative (<i>FAS</i> and <i>SOD2</i> vs. <i>Anaerococcus, Neisseria</i>, and <i>Acinetobacter</i>) were highlighted. Finally, we inspected volatile organic metabolite profiles in urinary samples and detected statistically significant differences (menthol, methanethiol, dihydrodehydro-beta-ionone, 2,5-dimethylfuran, 1,2,3,4, tetrahydro-1,5,7-trimethylnapthalene) when comparing AA and healthy subject groups. This multiple comparison approach highlighted potential traits associated with AA and their relationship with the microbiota inhabiting the scalp, opening up novel therapeutic interventions in such kind of hair growth disorders mainly by means of prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics.",

Medications that increase or substitute for dopamine can be used for the treatment of PD. Recently, numerous studies have shown gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating and maintaining multiple aspects of host physiology including host metabolism and neurodevelopment. In this review article, the role of gut microbiota in the etiological mechanism of PD will be reviewed. Furthermore, we discussed current pharmaceutical medicine-based methods to prevent and treat PD, followed by describing specific strains that affect the host brain function through the gut-brain axis. We explained in detail how gut microbiota directly produces neurotransmitters or regulate the host biosynthesis of neurotransmitters. The neurotransmitters secreted by the intestinal lumen bacteria may induce epithelial cells to release molecules that, in turn, can regulate neural signaling in the enteric nervous system and subsequently control brain function and behavior through the brain-gut axis. Finally, we proved that the microbial regulation of the host neuronal system. Endogenous α-syn can be transmitted long distance and bidirectional between ENS and brain through the circulatory system which gives us a new option that the possibility of altering the community of gut microbiota in completely new medication option for treating PD.",

While development of effective RV vaccines has offered significant protection against RV-associated mortality, vaccine effectiveness in low-income countries has been limited, potentially due to regional differences in the gut microbiota. In this mini review, we briefly detail research findings to date related to HRV vaccine cohorts, studies of natural infection, explorations of RV-microbiota interactions in gnotobiotic pig models, and highlight various <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> models that could be used in future studies to better define how the microbiota may regulate RV infection and host antiviral immune responses.",

Here, we analysed the influences of metabolites that are differentially abundant in IBD on the growth and physiology of gut bacteria that are also differentially abundant in IBD. We found that N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), a class of endogenously produced signalling lipids elevated in the stool of IBD patients and a T-cell transfer model of colitis, stimulated growth of species over-represented in IBD and inhibited that of species depleted in IBD in vitro. Using metagenomic sequencing, we recapitulated the effects of NAEs in complex microbial communities ex vivo, with Proteobacteria blooming and Bacteroidetes declining in the presence of NAEs. Metatranscriptomic analysis of the same communities identified components of the respiratory chain as important for the metabolism of NAEs, and this was verified using a mutant deficient for respiratory complex I. In this study, we identified NAEs as a class of metabolites that are elevated in IBD and have the potential to shift gut microbiota towards an IBD-like composition.",

The microbial metabolites analysed were short chain fatty acids (SCFA) both in plasma and feces, and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in plasma. The overall bacterial composition and diversity of bacterial community in the two groups were not significantly different. However, Ruminococcaceae NK4A214, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010, Christensenellaceae_R-7, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia hominis were found to be significantly enriched in NT group, whereas, Bacteroides coprocola, Bacteroides plebeius and genera of Lachnospiraceae were increased in HT patients. We found a positive correlation between the HT-associated species and systolic and diastolic blood pressure after adjusted for measured confounders. SCFA showed antagonistic results in plasma and feces, detecting in HT subjects significant higher levels in feces and lower levels in plasma, which could indicate a less efficient SCFA absorption.

    "abstract": "The two-step model for plant root microbiomes considers soil as the primary microbial source. Active selection of the plant's bacterial inhabitants results in a biodiversity decrease toward roots. We collected sixteen samples of <i>in situ</i> ruderal plant roots and their soils and used these soils as the main microbial input for single genotype tomatoes grown in a greenhouse. Our main goal was to test the soil influence in the structuring of rhizosphere microbiomes, minimizing environmental variability, while testing multiple plant species. We massively sequenced the 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomes of the soils, <i>in situ</i> plants, and tomato roots. We identified a total of 271,940 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within the soils, rhizosphere and endospheric microbiomes. We annotated by homology a total of 411,432 (13.07%) of the metagenome predicted proteins. Tomato roots did follow the two-step model with lower α-diversity than soil, while ruderal plants did not. Surprisingly, ruderal plants are probably working as a microenvironmental oasis providing moisture and plant-derived nutrients, supporting larger α-diversity. Ruderal plants and their soils are closer according to their microbiome community composition than tomato and its soil, based on OTUs and protein comparisons. We expected that tomato β-diversity clustered together with their soil, if it is the main rhizosphere microbiome structuring factor. However, tomato microbiome β-diversity was associated with plant genotype in most samples (81.2%), also supported by a larger set of enriched proteins in tomato rhizosphere than soil or ruderals. The most abundant bacteria found in soils was the Actinobacteria <i>Solirubrobacter soli</i>, ruderals were dominated by the Proteobacteria <i>Sphingomonas</i> sp. URGHD0057, and tomato mainly by the Bacteroidetes <i>Ohtaekwangia koreensis</i>, <i>Flavobacterium terrae, Niastella vici</i>, and <i>Chryseolinea serpens.</i> We calculated a metagenomic tomato root core of 51 bacterial genera and 2,762 proteins, which could be the basis for microbiome-oriented plant breeding programs. We attributed a larger diversity in ruderal plants roots exudates as an effect of the moisture and nutrient acting as a microbial harbor. The tomato and ruderal metagenomic differences are probably due to plant domestication trade-offs, impacting plant-bacteria interactions.",

Yet, little is known about gut microbiota dynamics during the early stages of ecological diversification and speciation. We sequenced the V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene to study the gut microbiota of Nicaraguan Midas cichlid fish (Amphilophus cf. citrinellus). Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that parallel divergence in trophic ecology in extremely young adaptive radiations from two crater lakes is associated with parallel changes of their gut microbiota.<h4>Results</h4>Bacterial communities of fish guts and lake water were highly distinct, indicating that the gut microbiota is shaped by host-specific factors. Among individuals of the same crater lake, differentiation in trophic ecology was weakly associated with gut microbiota differentiation, suggesting that diet, to some extent, affects the gut microbiota. However, differences in trophic ecology were much more pronounced across than within species whereas similar patterns were not observed for taxonomic and functional differences of the gut microbiota. Across the two crater lakes, we could not detect conclusive evidence for parallel changes of the gut microbiota associated with trophic ecology.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A lack of clearly differentiated niches during the early stages of ecological diversification might result in non-parallel changes of gut microbial communities, as observed in our study system as well as in other recently diverged fish species.

Here, we describe the gut bacterial and bacteriophage communities of Bangladeshi stunted children younger than 38 months. We show that these children harbor distinct gut bacteriophages relative to their non-stunted counterparts.

    "title": "Antibiotics as Major Disruptors of Gut Microbiota.",
    "abstract": "Advances in culture-independent research techniques have led to an increased understanding of the gut microbiota and the role it plays in health and disease. The intestine is populated by a complex microbial community that is organized around a network of metabolic interdependencies. It is now understood that the gut microbiota is vital for normal development and functioning of the human body, especially for the priming and maturation of the adaptive immune system. Antibiotic use can have several negative effects on the gut microbiota, including reduced species diversity, altered metabolic activity, and the selection of antibiotic-resistant organisms, which in turn can lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea and recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections. There is also evidence that early childhood exposure to antibiotics can lead to several gastrointestinal, immunologic, and neurocognitive conditions. The increase in the use of antibiotics in recent years suggests that these problems are likely to become more acute or more prevalent in the future. Continued research into the structure and function of the gut microbiota is required to address this challenge.",

    "abstract": "Adult honeybees harbor a specialized gut microbiota of relatively low complexity. While seasonal differences in community composition have been reported, previous studies have focused on compositional changes rather than differences in absolute bacterial loads. Moreover, little is known about the gut microbiota of winter bees, which live much longer than bees during the foraging season, and which are critical for colony survival. We quantified seven core members of the bee gut microbiota in a single colony over 2 years and characterized the community composition in 14 colonies during summer and winter. Our data show that total bacterial loads substantially differ between foragers, nurses, and winter bees. Long-lived winter bees had the highest bacterial loads and the lowest community α-diversity, with a characteristic shift toward high levels of Bartonella and Commensalibacter, and a reduction of opportunistic colonizers. Using gnotobiotic bee experiments, we show that diet is a major contributor to the observed differences in bacterial loads. Overall, our study reveals that the gut microbiota of winter bees is remarkably different from foragers and nurses. Considering the importance of winter bees for colony survival, future work should focus on the role of the gut microbiota in winter bee health and disease.",

    "abstract": "The melanocortin peptides have an important role in regulating body weight and appetite. Mice that lack the desacetyl-α-MSH and α-MSH peptides (Pomc<sup>tm1/tm1</sup>) develop obesity. This effect is exacerbated by a high fat diet (HFD). However, development of obesity in female Pomc<sup>tm1/tm1</sup> mice during chronic HFD conditions is not fully accounted for by the increased energy intake. We hypothesized that the protection against chronic HFD-induced obesity imparted by MSH peptides in females is mediated by sex-specific alterations in the gut structure and gut microbiota. We determined that female WT mice had reduced jejunum villus length and increased crypt depth in response to chronic HFD. WT males and Pomc<sup>tm1/tm1</sup> mice lacked this adaptation to a chronic HFD. Both Pomc<sup>tm1/tm1</sup> genotype and chronic HFD were significantly associated with gut microbiota composition. Sex-specific associations between Pomc<sup>tm1/tm1</sup> genotype and gut microbiota were observed in the presence of a chronic HFD. Pomc<sup>tm1/tm1</sup> females had significantly reduced fecal acetate and propionate concentrations when compared to WT females. We conclude that MSH peptides influence jejunum villus length, crypt depth and the structure of the gut microbiota. These effects favor reduced nutrient absorption and occur in addition to the recognized roles of desacetyl-α-MSH and α-MSH peptides in appetite control.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiome plays a central role in human health, and has been implicated in the development of a number of chronic gastrointestinal and systemic diseases. For example, microorganisms can serve as microbial endocrine mediators and can respond to stimuli and produce neurochemicals, ultimately influencing the brain-gut-microbiome axis of their host, a bidirectional communication system between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract, especially during developmental stages. To begin to explore potential dynamic changes of the gut microbiome, we characterized gut microbiota in adolescent rats that underwent a fixed period of restraint stress, examined whether the gut microbial population and their metabolic functions were changed by stress, and if such changes during adolescence persist or recover in young adulthood. Integrated 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing and liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) based metabolic profiling were utilized to discover any significant differences in gut microbial genus and microbial metabolites immediately at the end of the chronic restraint stress and three weeks after the stress treatment, compared to control rats that did not receive stress treatment. Interestingly, while adolescent chronic stress-induced differences in relative microbial abundance (i.e., microbial species and distribution) disappeared three weeks after the stress treatment ended, the differences in microbial metabolic profiles persisted into adulthood. In addition, a number of significantly altered metabolites and their correlated gut microbes detected in our study facilitated a possible connection between gut microbiota and host stress response, which can be further investigated in the future to study the causal relationship between gut microbial metabolites and their impact on human health.",

    "abstract": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a devastating acquired autoimmune disease. Previous studies have observed that disturbances of gut microbiome may attribute to the development of MG through fecal metabolomic signatures in humans. However, whether there were differential gut microbial and fecal metabolomic phenotypes in different subtypes of MG remains unclear. Here, our objective was to explore whether the microbial and metabolic signatures of ocular (OMG) and generalized myasthenia gravis (GMG) were different, and further identify the shared and distinct markers for patients with OMG and GMG. In this study, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) were performed to capture the microbial and metabolic signatures of OMG and GMG, respectively. Random forest (RF) classifiers was used to identify the discriminative markers for OMG and GMG. Compared with healthy control (HC) group, GMG group, but not OMG group, showed a significant decrease in α-phylogenetic diversity. Both OMG and GMG groups, however, displayed significant gut microbial and metabolic disorders. Totally, we identified 20 OTUs and 9 metabolites specific to OMG group, and 23 OTUs and 7 metabolites specific to GMG group. Moreover, combinatorial biomarkers containing 15 discriminative OTUs and 2 differential metabolites were capable of discriminating OMG and GMG from each other, as well as from HCs, with AUC values ranging from 0.934 to 0.990. In conclusion, different subtypes of MG harbored differential gut microbiota, which generated discriminative fecal metabolism.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Shotgun metagenomics based on untargeted sequencing can explore the taxonomic profile and the function of unknown microorganisms in samples, and complement the shortage of amplicon sequencing. Binning assembled sequences into individual groups, which represent microbial genomes, is the key step and a major challenge in metagenomic research. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods have been employed in binning. Genome binning belonging to unsupervised method clusters contigs into individual genome bins by machine learning methods without the assistance of any reference databases. So far a lot of genome binning tools have emerged. Evaluating these genome tools is of great significance to microbiological research. In this study, we evaluate 15 genome binning tools containing 12 original binning tools and 3 refining binning tools by comparing the performance of these tools on chicken gut metagenomic datasets and the first CAMI challenge datasets.<h4>Results</h4>For chicken gut metagenomic datasets, original genome binner MetaBat, Groopm2 and Autometa performed better than other original binner, and MetaWrap combined the binning results of them generated the most high-quality genome bins. For CAMI datasets, Groopm2 achieved the highest purity (> 0.9) with good completeness (> 0.8), and reconstructed the most high-quality genome bins among original genome binners. Compared with Groopm2, MetaBat2 had similar performance with higher completeness and lower purity. Genome refining binners DASTool predicated the most high-quality genome bins among all genomes binners. Most genome binner performed well for unique strains. Nonetheless, reconstructing common strains still is a substantial challenge for all genome binner.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In conclusion, we tested a set of currently available, state-of-the-art metagenomics hybrid binning tools and provided a guide for selecting tools for metagenomic binning by comparing range of purity, completeness, adjusted rand index, and the number of high-quality reconstructed bins. Furthermore, available information for future binning strategy were concluded.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities within the gut can markedly impact host health and fitness. To what extent environmental influences affect the differential distribution of these microbial populations may therefore significantly impact the successful farming of the host. Using a sea-based container culture (SBCC) system for the on-growing of European lobster (Homarus gammarus), we tracked the bacterial gut microbiota over a 1-year period. We compared these communities with lobsters of the same cohort, retained in a land-based culture (LBC) system to assess the effects of the culture environment on gut bacterial assemblage and describe the phylogenetic structure of the microbiota to compare deterministic and stochastic assembly across both environments. Bacterial gut communities from SBCCs were generally more phylogenetically clustered, and therefore deterministically assembled, compared to those reared in land-based systems. Lobsters in SBCCs displayed significantly more species-rich and species-diverse gut microbiota compared to those retained in LBC. A reduction in the bacterial diversity of the gut was also associated with higher infection prevalence of the enteric viral pathogen Homarus gammarus nudivirus (HgNV). SBCCs may therefore benefit the overall health of the host by promoting the assembly of a more diverse gut bacterial community and reducing the susceptibility to disease.",

    "abstract": "Experiments involving food restriction are common practice in metabolic research. Under fasted conditions, mice supplement their diet with cage bedding. We aimed at identifying metabolic and microbiota-related parameters affected by the bedding type. We exposed mice housed with wooden, cellulose, or corncob cage beddings to ad libitum feeding, caloric restriction (CR), or over-night (ON) fasting. Additionally, two subgroups of the ON fast group were kept without any bedding or on a metal grid preventing coprophagy. Mice under CR supplemented their diet substantially with bedding; however, the amount varied depending on the kind of bedding. Bedding-related changes in body weight loss, fat loss, cecum size, stomach weight, fecal output, blood ghrelin levels as well as a response to glucose oral tolerance test were recorded. As fiber is fermented by the gut bacteria, the type of bedding affects gut bacteria and fecal metabolites composition of CR mice. CR wood and cellulose groups showed distinct cecal metabolite and microbiome profiles when compared to the CR corncob group. While all ad libitum fed animal groups share similar profiles. We show that restriction-related additional intake of bedding-derived fiber modulates multiple physiological parameters. Therefore, the previous rodent studies on CR, report the combined effect of CR and increased fiber consumption.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Microbial communities have become an important subject of research across multiple disciplines in recent years. These communities are often examined via shotgun metagenomic sequencing, a technology which can offer unique insights into the genomic content of a microbial community. Functional annotation of shotgun metagenomic data has become an increasingly popular method for identifying the aggregate functional capacities encoded by the community's constituent microbes. Currently available metagenomic functional annotation pipelines, however, suffer from several shortcomings, including limited pipeline customization options, lack of standard raw sequence data pre-processing, and insufficient capabilities for integration with distributed computing systems.<h4>Results</h4>Here we introduce MetaLAFFA, a functional annotation pipeline designed to take unfiltered shotgun metagenomic data as input and generate functional profiles. MetaLAFFA is implemented as a Snakemake pipeline, which enables convenient integration with distributed computing clusters, allowing users to take full advantage of available computing resources. Default pipeline settings allow new users to run MetaLAFFA according to common practices while a Python module-based configuration system provides advanced users with a flexible interface for pipeline customization. MetaLAFFA also generates summary statistics for each step in the pipeline so that users can better understand pre-processing and annotation quality.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MetaLAFFA is a new end-to-end metagenomic functional annotation pipeline with distributed computing compatibility and flexible customization options. MetaLAFFA source code is available at https://github.com/borenstein-lab/MetaLAFFA and can be installed via Conda as described in the accompanying documentation.",

All these factors fluctuate seasonally, especially in areas with highly variable climatic conditions between seasons. Seasonal microbiota changes were reported in several previous studies. The purpose of our study was to investigate whether there is a seasonal variability in the gut microbiota composition in Ukrainian population. In contrast to previous studies performed on small-size samples using a longitudinal design, we used cross-sectional design with a large sample size (n = 769). Determination of microbial composition at the level of major microbial phyla was performed by qRT-PCR.<h4>Results</h4>The relative abundance of major taxonomic groups of gut microbiota was found to be affected by month of sampling. Actinobacteria were more abundant and Bacteroidetes were less abundant in summer-derived samples compared to those obtained during other seasons, whereas Firmicutes content was seasonally independent. The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio was significantly higher in summer-derived samples than in winter-derived ones. Odds to have F/B > 1 were 3.3 times higher in summer samples and 1.9 times higher in autumn samples than in winter ones; neither age, nor sex were significant confounding factors.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Seasonality of sampling could influence results of human microbiome research, thereby potentially biasing estimates.

    "abstract": "The microbial community in the gut is influenced by environmental factors, especially diet, which can moderate host behaviour through the microbiome-gut-brain axis. However, the ecological relevance of microbiome-mediated behavioural plasticity in wild animals is unknown. We presented wild-caught great tits (Parus major) with a problem-solving task and showed that performance was weakly associated with variation in the gut microbiome. We then manipulated the gut microbiome by feeding birds one of two diets that differed in their relative levels of fat, protein and fibre content: an insect diet (low content), or a seed diet (high content). Microbial communities were less diverse among individuals given the insect compared to those on the seed diet. Individuals were less likely to problem-solve after being given the insect diet, and the same microbiota metrics that were altered as a consequence of diet were also those that correlated with variation in problem solving performance. Although the effect on problem-solving behaviour could have been caused by motivational or nutritional differences between our treatments, our results nevertheless raise the possibility that dietary induced changes in the gut microbiota could be an important mechanism underlying individual behavioural plasticity in wild populations.",

The panel considered that variable outcomes of FMT relate to compositional and functional differences in recipient's microbiota, and likely donor-associated and recipient-associated physiological and genetic factors. Taxonomic composition of donor intestinal microbiota may influence the efficacy of FMT in recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections and UC. FMT not only alters bacteria composition but also establishes trans-kingdom equilibrium between gut fungi, viruses and bacteria to promote the recovery of microbial homeostasis.

The combination of <i>m3</i> with <i>Fn</i>, <i>Ch</i>, <i>Bacteroides clarus</i> and FIT performed best for diagnosing CRC (specificity=81.2% and sensitivity=93.8%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study identifies a novel bacterial marker <i>m3</i> for the non-invasive diagnosis of colorectal adenoma.",
